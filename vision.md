# Vision: The Verdant Accord

This document captures the creative direction, tonal guardrails, and craft rules that guide revision. It’s a living artifact—update as we learn more.

## Core Premise

- In a floating eco‑city (Luminara), optimized systems collide with emergent, community‑driven networks. An engineer (Amara Solis) uncovers a corporate plan to map, replicate, and replace grassroots solutions, forcing a choice between control and connection.

## Themes (North Stars)

- Autonomy vs. optimization (systems that serve vs. systems that control)
- Community as intelligence (mutual aid, emergent networks, living tech)
- Trust and accountability in socio‑technical systems
- Healing as design principle: adaptation > extraction

## Tone & Aesthetic

- Eco‑futurist, tactile tech (bioluminescence, living circuits, moss walls)
- Hopeful‑tense: stakes are high, but ingenuity + solidarity create momentum
- Technical clarity without jargon walls; concrete metaphors for complex systems

## POV, Tense, Distance

- POV: Primarily Amara (3rd, close). Occasional shifts (Ravi, Nia, Elena) if needed.
- Tense: Past
- Distance: Close for character beats; pull to medium for system vistas

## Protagonist Snapshot (Amara Solis)

- Strengths: Systems thinking, ethical rigor, humility
- Flaws: Isolation reflex, deference to institutional authority, grief for past compromises
- Arc (draft): From optimizing for control → designing for connection; learns to trust emergent complexity and community agency

## Antagonistic Pressure

- Corporate program (via Dr. Veltri, council) to “optimize” the city by mapping and replacing unofficial networks. Drones + protocols that mimic growth cycles to evade detection.

## World Rules (Working)

- Living tech interfaces (algae marks, neural gardens) are informative and expressive
- Grid anomalies can encode social patterns (who helps whom); mapping them has political stakes
- Community networks evolve under pressure; optimization can learn—but so can the commons

## Craft Guardrails

- Always frame technical systems around human implications
- Show tradeoffs; no strawmen—corporate tech is elegant and tempting
- Keep scene purpose explicit: decision, discovery, reversal, or connection

## Open Questions

- Dr. Veltri’s true motivation and endpoint—reformable, tragic, or ideologue?
- City council’s fault lines—who can be turned?
- What catalyzes public alignment with community networks?

## Style Cheatsheet

- Replace abstract system talk with concrete sensory images (light, flow, pulse)
- Repeat visual motifs for continuity (blood‑red arrays, pulsing algae, geometric shadows)
- Keep beats tight: 1 paragraph ≈ 1 move; vary sentence length to modulate tension

## Process Notes

- Mark scene boundaries with `***` or `### Scene: <title>`
- Update scene metadata with `pov`, `location`, `timeline`, and `purpose` as we revise
- Regenerate inventory and timeline to keep cross‑refs current
