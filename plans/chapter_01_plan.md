# Chapter 1 Plan — THE LUMINARA HORIZON

- POV: Amara only (close third)
- Function: Inciting anomaly; frame the moral axis (growth vs. control); seed foreshadowing of emergent behavior; set Council/Veltri pressure; choose to engage Verdant Network.
- Status: Modified (no head-hopping; Nia moved to Ch2)

## Scene Beats

1) Observation Deck — Wrong Note [MOD]
- Goal: Validate Sector 7 anomaly; establish Amara’s embodied “listening.”
- Conflict: Subthreshold variance (her own thresholds); public spectacle obscures concern.
- Turn: Micro-swarm of maintenance drones mirror a bird murmuration (Amara blames “sensor fusion”).
- Outcome: Suspicion engaged; foreshadow seed 1 placed (drone mimicry → later learning).

2) Grid Control — Heartbeat Siphon [MOD]
- Goal: Confirm siphon; implicate insider keys.
- Conflict: Council greenlights Solace demo; thresholds she wrote ignore “unsanctioned/inefficient” signatures.
- Turn: A brief “harmony spike” stabilizes multiple subsystems and is logged as a glitch.
- Outcome: Foreshadow seed 2 (spontaneous cross-stabilization); Amara heads to demo on Ravi’s push.

3) Sector 7 Perimeter — Unauthorized Flowers (solo) [MOD/RENAME]
- Goal: Ground a physical clue without meeting Nia yet.
- Conflict: Substation “cold on paper, warm in the wires”; no official draw.
- Turn: Solace sun-stamp beneath pollen; streetlights “catch breath” together (momentary stabilization echo).
- Outcome: Foreshadow seed 3 (cross-system breath); defer Nia’s first on-page to Ch2.

4) Veltri’s Lab — Support vs. Control [MOD]
- Goal: Philosophical clash; global ambition vs. local life.
- Conflict: Veltri frames standardization as scaffolding for scale.
- Turn: “Acceptable losses” overlay visible in sim (names/blocks grayed as tolerable).
- Outcome: Amara feels the hidden human cost; fracture solidifies.

4a) Night Run (Insert) — Acceptable Losses [NEW]
- Goal: Interior hinge (emotion > plot); choose Verdant Network.
- Conflict: Rewatching sim, she overlays her baselines; the gray zones are known places.
- Turn: Realizes her thresholds made those places invisible—her design contributed.
- Outcome: Sends Verdant ping; resolves to act.

5) Apartment Dawn — Patterns Click [MOD]
- Goal: Synthesize: festival drain + Sector 7 + plant signatures ⇒ “practice, not failure.”
- Conflict: Council agenda arrives—full Solace vote imminent.
- Turn: Message from Verdant to meet at dawn; she commits to bring proof.
- Outcome: Packs field kit + biotecture sample; commitment beat.

## Foreshadow & Setups
- Drone murmuration (S1) → drones “dance” later; variance reservoirs redirect (Ch7).
- Harmony spike + cross-system breath (S2/S3) → later self-stabilization of learning state.
- Thresholds blind spots (S2/S4a) → accountability fix-in-field (Ch8 S2).
- “Acceptable losses” UI (S4/S4a) → Veltri’s wound/motivation; moral stakes on-page.

## Continuity/Rules
- Establish: Official sensors/thresholds ignore unsanctioned signals; Amara authored them.
- Council: Demo tonight; integration vote tomorrow.

## Open Questions
- Specific names/blocks for “acceptable losses” overlay? Pick 2–3 to recur later.
- Short line to hint Amara/Veltri shared lab hack ethos (warmth before fracture).

## Page Target
- 14–18 manuscript pages total (tighter prose; no tours).
