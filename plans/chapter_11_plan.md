# Chapter 11 Plan — HARMONY FIELDS

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Daily-life integration deepens; keep sequences specific and local; celebrate difference while noting limits.
- Status: Template

## Scene Beats (Draft)
- 11.1 Morning harmonics (one market pass): show two traditions strengthening each other.
- 11.2 Exchange harmony (one transaction cluster) → value-as-relationship.
- 11.3 Social/space learning (one room/one practice); measures of success shift.
- 11.4 Night preparation: communities co-prepare for next change (not climax, but readiness).

## Constraints
- One tight example per beat; avoid list-making; stay in Amara’s senses.
