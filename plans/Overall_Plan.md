**Objectives**
- Adult SF (solarpunk/hopepunk), 95–110k, Book 1 with a contained arc.
- Character-driven climax: Amara’s agency (harmonic seed) catalyzes change.
- End with seeded transformation (local-first pilots), not instant transcendence.
- Streamline mid-act with action-led reveals; no “tours.”
- Deepen Veltri (flashback anchor; final shaken/awe human beat).
- Elevate Nia’s agency; make costs real (Nia injury + equipment loss).
- Maintain Amara-only close-third POV; make sensor-blindness explicit.

**Locked Decisions**
- Genre/tone: Adult SF; solarpunk/hopepunk.
- Word count: 95–110k; standalone arc within a larger world.
- Climax: inject S7 harmonic seed at dampener soft-start; face-to-face Amara–Veltri.
- Ending: pilot corridors + gradual adoption.
- Pacing: consolidate settlement reveals; 3 setbacks; earlier action reveal retained.
- Antagonist: subcontinent simulation flashback; humanized awe at climax.
- Supporting: Nia’s subplot elevated.
- POV: Amara only; diagnostics “blindness” stated in-text.
- Submission: cerebral-hopeful query; comps to be proposed; synopsis emphasizes earned victory + seeded change.

**Status Summary (Applied Changes)**
- Agency-driven climax seeded and attributed to Amara
  - scenes/ch06-sc02-the-corporate-agenda.md: Amara injects S7‑HELIOTROPIC.SEED and times phase to adaptation “breath.”
  - scenes/ch06-sc03-the-corporate-agenda.md: face-to-face exchange; Veltri recognizes Amara’s action; human beat connects to flashback logic.
- Seeded transformation ending
  - scenes/ch07-sc04-new-growth.md: scaled to pilot corridors; cautious, local-first spread.
- Chapter 4 enhancements (foreshadowing, stakes, POV)
  - scenes/ch04-sc01-shadows-in-the-grid.md: Amara’s introspection on past optimization costs.
  - scenes/ch04-sc02-shadows-in-the-grid.md: Amara–Kevin friction; sensor-blindness explicit; investigative overlays shown; harmonic fingerprint captured; equipment loss setback; POV anchor (“Amara realized…”).
  - scenes/ch04-sc03-shadows-in-the-grid.md: Nia’s injury creates tactical constraint.
  - scenes/ch04-sc04-shadows-in-the-grid.md: Veltri “scaffolding” memory; Amara seeds “teach it to breathe.”
- Action-led reveal in mid-act retained and strengthened
  - scenes/ch02-sc03-the-wasteland-connection.md: Lantern House rescue under drone pressure (breathing rhythm; textiles as variance reservoirs).
  - scenes/ch02-sc04-the-wasteland-connection.md: exposition converted to physical evidence (drone tag cache).

**Remaining Work (To Revise)**
- Mid-Act Streamlining (consolidate tours and duplicates)
  - Merge overlapping settlement/worldbuilding reveals into fewer, pressure-driven set pieces.
  - Files to audit: scenes/ch02-sc02-the-wasteland-connection.md, scenes/ch02-sc03-the-wasteland-connection.md, scenes/ch03-sc01-the-verdant-network.md, scenes/ch03-sc02-the-verdant-network.md, scenes/ch03-sc03-the-verdant-network.md, scenes/ch05-sc01-fractured-alliances.md through scenes/ch05-sc06-fractured-alliances.md.
  - Tasks:
    - Remove/merge duplicate team-intro beats; ensure a single, impactful “first meet.”
    - Convert any remaining explainers into interleaved discovery (logs, physical evidence, brief memory bites, problem solving under time pressure).
    - Maintain city:Wastelands ratio ≈ 60:40 across middle chapters.

- Stakes & Costs (3 setbacks fully on-page)
  - Already present: Lantern House emergency; equipment loss (probe); Nia injury/lag.
  - Add one “node sacrifice” beat to buy time (e.g., a ghost path goes dark or a relay burns out under load) prior to council vote.
  - Add a visible civilian-risk/triage moment (brief evac/tough call) to humanize stakes beyond technical risk.
  - Candidate files: scenes/ch05-sc04-fractured-alliances.md, scenes/ch06-sc01-the-corporate-agenda.md, scenes/ch06-sc02-the-corporate-agenda.md.

- Antagonist Arc (reinforce flashback and nuance)
  - Optional brief flashback bite (subcontinent sim) earlier in Ch. 1 or 2 for symmetry with Ch. 4/6 references.
  - Optional coda in scenes/ch06-sc04-the-corporate-agenda.md: post-vote human exchange (Veltri’s shaken/awe beat without reversal).

- POV/Voice Audit
  - Sweep for any remaining omniscient-leaning lines; anchor as Amara’s inference (use “Amara realized/noted/felt”).
  - Sharpen voice distinctions where helpful (Veltri = algorithms/scaffolding; Kevin = botany/salvage analogies; Nia = living-systems cadence).
  - Candidate areas: scenes/ch02-*, scenes/ch03-*, scenes/ch05-*.

- World/Logic
  - Ensure “sensor blindness” principle appears where relevant (brief lines, as done in Ch. 4) to justify earlier ignorance and reinforce theme of systemic bias.
  - Verify council timeline cues remain consistent after edits.

- Submission Package (post-revisions)
  - Comps: propose 3 recent titles; select 2 for query.
  - Query: cerebral-hopeful tone; hook on living city + mentor/protégé fracture + “teach the mesh to breathe.”
  - Synopsis: emphasize earned victory + seeded transformation (not deus ex); reflect setbacks and human costs.

**Milestones & Order of Work**
- M1 Mid-Act Streamlining
  - Consolidate “tours”; interleave reveals with action; maintain 60/40 balance.
  - Deliverables: revised scenes in Ch. 2–3–5 with trimmed exposition and merged beats.
- M2 Stakes & Costs Reinforcement
  - Add “node sacrifice” + one visible civilian-risk moment; confirm three-setback pattern.
- M3 Antagonist Depth & Coda
  - Insert optional brief flashback bite; add post-vote human coda in Ch. 6 Sc. 4.
- M4 POV/Voice Audit + World/Logic Touch-ups
  - Anchor any remaining omniscient drifts; add sensor-blindness lines where needed.
- M5 Submission Package
  - Draft comps, query, synopsis aligned to the new spine.

**Backlog: Diff-Ready TODOs (Remaining)**
- Node sacrifice (choose spot)
  - scenes/ch06-sc02-the-corporate-agenda.md or scenes/ch05-sc04-fractured-alliances.md: add 2–3 lines indicating a ghost path/relay deliberately burned to hold the rhythm for evac.
- Civilian-risk/triage beat (choose spot)
  - scenes/ch05-sc04-fractured-alliances.md: brief corridor decision where limited power is routed to med warmers over surveillance; consequence acknowledged.
- Optional Veltri coda
  - scenes/ch06-sc04-the-corporate-agenda.md: 4–6 lines, shaken/awe without capitulation; echoes “scaffolding vs. growth.”
- Optional early flashback bite
  - scenes/ch01-sc04-the-luminara-horizon.md or scenes/ch02-sc01-the-wasteland-connection.md: 1–2 lines referencing the subcontinent sim outcome as a shared memory.
- POV anchor tags
  - Sweep scenes/ch02-*, scenes/ch03-*, scenes/ch05-* and add “Amara realized/noted” where needed.

**Risks & Mitigations**
- Risk: Over-sentimental ending → Mitigation: keep “pilot corridors” language; show uneven adoption.
- Risk: Deus ex perception → Mitigation: clear cause/effect (seed timing + vulnerability window) and on-page costs.
- Risk: Antagonist flattening → Mitigation: flashback anchor + human beat; avoid strawman rhetoric.

**Definition of Done**
- Climax attribution clear; face-off present; costs visible; ending scaled.
- Mid-act has no redundant tours; reveals occur under pressure; city:Wastelands ~60:40.
- Three setbacks on page (Lantern House + equipment loss + injury + node sacrifice/triage).
- Veltri arc deepened (flashback/coda present).
- POV discipline intact; sensor-blindness threaded where relevant.
- Submission package drafted with comps, query, synopsis.
