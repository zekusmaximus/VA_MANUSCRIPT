# Chapter 8 Plan — GROWING PAINS (Climax, Part 3 Aftershock)

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Immediate aftermath; acknowledge strain; Amara’s accountability repair; governance chooses local growth; one global hint only.
- Status: Modified/Redesigned

## Scene Beats

1) Back-pressure — Integration Isn’t Instant [MOD]
- Goal: Stabilize mixed state post-turn.
- Conflict: Phase mismatches; latency spikes; some dampeners still clamp.
- Turn: Amara prioritizes triage over elegance; writes/accepts messy rules of resilience.
- Outcome: City breathes; imperfect self-stabilization.

2) Accountability — Fix What I Broke [NEW]
- Goal: Repair a blackout caused by her old thresholding schema—on the ground.
- Conflict: Community harm from “elegant” control; manual collective fix.
- Turn: Documents new rule-of-thumb: variability needs participation; dampeners suppress variance; reservoirs counter it; authorizations + legacy-handshake notes.
- Outcome: Personal atonement lands; tech rule articulated in-story.

3) Council Adjourns to Process — Local Proof, Global Seed [MOD]
- Goal: Immediate policy shift without utopian sweep.
- Conflict: Metrics vs. lived evidence.
- Turn: Temporary moratorium on full Solace integration; pilot “living protocols” adopted in critical services.
- Outcome: Local victory; Amara receives a single “postcard” ping (e.g., New Singapore atmospheric hello).

## Continuity/Rules
- Epilogue later will remain local; global change is a seed, not a montage.
