# Chapter 2 Plan — THE WASTELAND CONNECTION

- POV: Amara only
- Function: First contact with Verdant/Wasteland under pressure; convert tours into action; seed friction with Kevin; first field save; plant Veltri backstory wound via Memory node.
- Status: Modified/Compressed

## Scene Beats

1) Sector Boundary — Different Maps [MOD]
- Goal: Validate global pattern with Nia/Jin/Elena; implicate Veltri with audits.
- Conflict: Trust deficit; Amara’s designs exploited; time pressure (drones in 4h).
- Turn: Kevin arrives; overlays expose disciplined disruptions across cities and the hidden community underlay.
- Outcome: Choice: go see the truth up close.

2) Descent — Camouflage & Necessity [TRIM]
- Goal: Reach Hidden Garden without being mapped.
- Conflict: Early sweep; evasive path through thermal bloom.
- Turn: Amara recognizes waste-heat harvest and disguised collectors → grudging respect.
- Outcome: They vanish into the Hidden Garden; time box tightens.

3) Hidden Garden — Patch Under Fire [MOD]
- Goal: Save a nearby shelter that just went dark (live problem > tour).
- Conflict: Corporate sweep escalates; Amara must adapt her own reactor/failsafe logic to “messy” inputs (roots + textiles).
- Turn: She rewrites thresholds in the field; Nia stabilizes botanics despite risk.
- Outcome: Shelter up; trust via competence; exposition delivered through the fix.

4) Memory/Archive Node — Pattern of Takeovers [TRIM/SPLIT]
- Goal: Show repeating corporate method; seed Veltri wound.
- Conflict: Evidence overload vs. time; drones tightening scans.
- Turn: Memory of early Veltri “trellis not control,” then collapse during crisis; Amara sees how “support→control” scaled.
- Outcome: Plan to get Helios baselines during demo; Council must feel human stakes.

## Foreshadow & Setups
- Serra’s fabric gift prefigured (if not yet delivered): later becomes variance key (Ch6/7).
- First mention of variance reservoirs (kids’ textiles + root nets) as a contingency concept to return to.
- Amara/Kevin friction: “fix variables” vs. “evolve with constraints.”

## Continuity/Rules
- Tours avoided; all reveals occur under time pressure or during live fixes.
- Keep Nia’s first on-page here (not in Ch1).

## Open Questions
- Which shelter do we save (tie to a named person for payoff in Ch7/8)?
- One line of Ravi comms for Helios demo access risk profile.

## Page Target
- 16–20 pages (action-driven; concise worldbuilding).
