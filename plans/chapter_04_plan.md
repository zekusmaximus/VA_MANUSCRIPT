# Chapter 4 Plan — SHADOWS IN THE GRID

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Reactor re-entry setup; show corporate convergence tightening; team forms for a strike-and-save mission.
- Status: Template (align to streamline arc; no tours)

## Scene Beats (Draft)
- 4.1 Command brief → select small team (Amara/Kevin/Nia + Ravi on comms).
- 4.2 Approach Sector 7; patterns prove legacy systems stirring; corporate converging.
- 4.3 Enter/wake reactor (initial pass); glimpse legacy mesh behavior; extract safe paths.
- 4.4 Exit under pressure; cost lands (injury or equipment loss sets stakes).

## Foreshadow & Setups
- Legacy handshake responsiveness to Amara (seed for catalytic act).
- Cooling/biologic stability dependency (Nia skill importance → later injury stakes).

## Continuity/Rules
- Keep all action in Amara’s senses; allies via comms.

## Open Questions
- Exact injury/cost distribution here vs. Ch6.
