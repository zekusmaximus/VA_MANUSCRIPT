# Chapter 10 Plan — RESONANCE PATTERNS

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Introduce paradox/edge-of-frame phenomena as credible next-threshold without abandoning grounded causality; keep it in sensory/diagnostic terms.
- Status: Template

## Scene Beats (Draft)
- 10.1 Morning discordance: integration matrices show valid, incompatible readings; Amara labels as “edges of understanding.”
- 10.2 Tradition lenses: short triad (archives/tide/wind) interpreting paradox.
- 10.3 Amara stakes: testable hypotheses and safety rails set for next day.

## Guardrails
- No cosmic handwave; all phenomena framed as observations Amara records and plans to test.
