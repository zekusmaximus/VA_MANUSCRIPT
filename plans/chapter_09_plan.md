# Chapter 9 Plan — GLOBAL CURRENTS

- POV: Amara only
- Function: One external signal per sequence; show distinct regional awakenings without montage bloat; keep it experiential via Amara’s interfaces.
- Status: Template

## Scene Beats (Draft)
- 9.1 First atmospheric “postcard” arrives (New Singapore) → Amara interprets.
- 9.2 Market/exchange riff: mutual growth patterns (one focused exchange only).
- 9.3 Memory keeping variations: light/tide/root/atmo — one compact triad of examples.
- 9.4 Close with Amara’s sense of plurality → feeds back into local choices.

## Constraints
- Keep to 2–3 precise vignettes; avoid sweeping montage.
