# Chapter 12 Plan — WILD GARDENS

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Culminate local flourishing; keep victories local/tangible; hold a single global hint; foreshadow next threshold lightly.
- Status: Template

## Scene Beats (Draft)
- 12.1 Morning: local evidence of resilience (named shelter/garden/medical backup thriving).
- 12.2 Relationships as infrastructure: brief Network beat showing care→robustness.
- 12.3 Lab reflection with Veltri: wonder, no conversion; shared humility.
- 12.4 Children’s play: seed of next mathematics/possibility—one beat only.

## Constraints
- No montage of world; one “postcard” at most.
