# Chapter 6 Plan — THE CORPORATE AGENDA (Climax, Part 1)

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Set the three-front plan; reactor re-entry; Helios baselines heist (via comms); council confrontation; initiate catalytic act.
- Status: Modified/Redesigned

## Scene Beats

1) Dawn Prep — Three Fronts [MOD]
- Goal: Lock roles: (A) Reactor re-entry, (B) Helios baselines, (C) Council proof.
- Conflict: Dampeners staged; chamber access; time short.
- Turn: Serra’s fabric square (bioelectric keyed) handed to Amara as variance key.
- Outcome: Amara commits to potentially holding the channel.

2) Reactor Re-Entry — Wake the Ancestor [MOD]
- Goal: Bring legacy mesh to life as alt-path.
- Conflict: Semi-organic drones adapt; Nia injured stabilizing bio-interfaces.
- Turn: Legacy handshake works only if Amara relaxes clean failsafes to accept hybrid inputs.
- Outcome: Fragile but open channel; Nia remains on comms, retuning botanics.

3) Helios Spiral Heist (via feed) — Steal the Baselines [NEW]
- Goal: Ravi/Jin team extracts Solace baselines during demo.
- Conflict: Dampener soft-start; kids’ textiles must remain hidden.
- Turn: Ravi cuts a tuned segment (sacrifice) to prevent cascade; ships “ghost paths” + baselines to Amara.
- Outcome: Last ingredient for chaos seed obtained; cost logged.

4) Council Chamber — Acceptable Losses on the Record [MOD]
- Goal: Force moral stakes; expose real harm.
- Conflict: Veltri’s elegant symphony vs. Amara’s live overlays (gardens/shelters) under dampener tests.
- Turn: Veltri offers “safe corridors” (partial preservation) if Amara stands down.
- Outcome: Amara refuses curated survival.

5) Threshold — Hold the Channel [NEW]
- Goal: Commit to catalytic act.
- Conflict: Holding legacy channel risks overload; allies stretched; drones converge.
- Turn: Injects structured unpredictability (legacy handshake + baselines + hybrid reservoirs via fabric key).
- Outcome: Chaos seed initiated; countdown begins.

## Foreshadow & Setups
- Fabric key; legacy handshake; baselines; variance reservoirs — all pre-seeded.

## Continuity/Rules
- All off-site action via comms/HUD; Amara interprets it; no head-hopping.
