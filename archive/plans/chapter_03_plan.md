# Chapter 3 Plan — THE VERDANT NETWORK

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Enter the Verdant hub; align on plan (proof + baselines + variance reservoirs); avoid direct fight; Amara owns past harm.
- Status: Modified (focus + foreshadow)

## Scene Beats

1) Abandoned Botanic Center — Spaces Between [MOD]
- Goal: Arrive at hub; see hybrid systems as legible threat/hope.
- Conflict: Drones refactor Amara’s monitoring code for control; vote fast-tracked.
- Turn: Agree on near-term goals: (1) human stakes proof; (2) grab Helios baselines during demo; (3) seed variance reservoirs across neighborhoods.
- Outcome: Shared direction under time pressure.

2) Strategy Fracture → Coalesce [MOD]
- Goal: Set philosophy: growth-as-weapon, not attack.
- Conflict: Hit back vs. preserve; Jin’s threat maps vs. Nia’s “gardens breathe.”
- Turn: Amara reframes: let them map everything and evolve past the map; commits to Helios baselines + variance seeding.
- Outcome: Plan alignment; Amara admits thresholds harm (sets up atonement in Ch8 S2).

3) Attack Onset (via feeds) [MOD]
- Goal: Tie evidence to urgency; raise cost.
- Conflict: Drones shift patterns (organic-like); “convergence protocol” signatures appear; a shelter flickers again.
- Turn: Team keeps people alive while capturing proof; Veltri adapts in real time.
- Outcome: Stakes locked; Helios heist flagged for demo window.

## Foreshadow & Setups
- “Variance reservoirs” term and specific placements (kids’ textiles workshops; root-net hubs) → catalytic turn in Ch7.
- Council chamber access and Solace hardware staged → confrontation in Ch6.

## Continuity/Rules
- All off-site events arrive via Amara’s comms/HUD; no POV breaks.
- Confirm Solace dampeners = arrested evolution; reservoirs counter by injecting controlled variance.

## Open Questions
- Which neighborhoods get reservoir seeding on-page to pay off later?
- One signature image from each reservoir type (threaded child garment; root node; atmo chorus).

## Page Target
- 14–18 pages.
