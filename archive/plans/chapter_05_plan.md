# Chapter 5 Plan — FRACTURED ALLIANCES

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Rising losses; arguments over tactics; locate moments of growth-in-loss; commit to proof + baselines + reservoir seeding.
- Status: Template (focus beats; trim repetition)

## Scene Beats (Draft)
- 5.1 Monitoring losses; identify predatory adaptation; name human stakes (named gardens/shelters).
- 5.2 Debate fractures; Amara reframes with “breath” vulnerability window.
- 5.3 Deep Gardens memory: older-than-Luminara systems → resilience lesson.
- 5.4 Consolidate: proof capture plan; reservoir placements scheduled; Helios demo window locked.

## Foreshadow & Setups
- “Breath” windows in corporate adaptation → exploit later in Ch6/7.

## Continuity/Rules
- No tour; discoveries emerge while handling live problems.
