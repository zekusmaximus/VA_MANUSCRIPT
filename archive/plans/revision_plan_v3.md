# Verdant Accord — Revision Plan (v3)

**Updated**: Incorporating author feedback and critique analysis
**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Strategic Focus**: Add missing causality with minimal, high-value additions

---

## Definition of Done

- All tasks completed in `scenes/*.md` files (source of truth)
- Compiled .v3 manuscript generated after scene revisions complete
- Word count progress toward 90,000+ (acknowledging ~13k gap remains after this phase)
- Timeline consistency verified against timeline.md

---

## Strategic Principles (From Author)

1. **Primary goal**: Add missing causality that doesn't exist
2. **Secondary goal**: Make implicit causality explicit only where needed
3. **Reader trust**: Trust readers to infer as much as possible with clear signals
4. **Voice**: Maintain lyrical, organic prose style
5. **Additions**: Include only if earned, necessary, or add to aesthetic

---

## Word Count Reality

- **Current**: ~75,000 words
- **Target**: 90,000 words
- **Gap**: ~15,000 words
- **This plan addresses**: ~1,300-2,100 words (Phase 1)
- **Remaining**: ~13k words (requires separate Phase 2 strategy)

---

## Phase 1: Minimal High-Value Additions

### 1. Memory Garden → Council Evidence Chain ✅

**Missing Causality**: Readers see Amara viewing Singapore/Rio data but not see her planning to use it in council

**SCENE 1**: ch03-sc03-the-verdant-network.md
**Placement**: After line 51 (end of scene, after Kevin/Amara moment)
**Add**:
```
"We'll need this for the council," Amara said, already pulling telemetry.
"Singapore and Rio—before and after. Let them see what 'optimization'
actually means."

Kevin nodded. "No theory. Just consequence."
```
**Words**: ~35
**Value**: Creates explicit causality link to council scene

---

**SCENE 2**: ch06-sc02-the-corporate-agenda.md
**Placement**: Before line 44 (before existing Lantern House evidence)
**Add**:
```
Amara touched the chamber walls. Memory Garden data bloomed—Singapore's
living corridors before and after standardization; Rio's gardens breathing,
then flattened. "This is what you're proposing," she said quietly.
```
**Words**: ~30
**Value**: Payoff to Memory Garden setup; shows historical precedent before current crisis

**Total for Evidence Chain**: ~65 words

---

### 2. Selective Clock Tethers ✅

**Missing Causality**: Temporal urgency sometimes vague between faction scenes and vote

**Timeline Reality** (from timeline.md):
- Day 1 (Ch3): Vote initially "today" but postponed
- Day 2 (Ch4): Vote confirmed for dawn (Day 3)
- Day 3 (Ch6): Vote happens, morning

**SCENE 1**: ch03-sc03-the-verdant-network.md
**Placement**: End of scene (after new evidence text above)
**Add**:
```
"The vote comes at dawn. Hours to gather proof."
```
**Words**: ~10
**Value**: Clear temporal frame without over-explaining

---

**SCENE 2**: ch05-sc02-fractured-alliances.md
**Placement**: End of scene
**Add**:
```
Before dawn, before the vote, they would need this data—and the storm-taught
wisdom the algorithms could never predict.
```
**Words**: ~20
**Value**: Temporal urgency + thematic closure

**Total for Clock Tethers**: ~30 words

---

**PHASE 1 TOTAL**: ~95 words

---

## Phase 2: New Scene - Veltri Flashback ✅

### Veltri + Amara: Pearl Clinic Decision

**Missing Causality**: Reader sees Veltri as controller (present) and hears she believed in growth (past), but missing the pivot moment

**NEW SCENE**: ch03-sc09-veltri-amara-pearl.md
**Placement**: After ch03-sc08 (existing Nia Pearl flashback)
**Coordinates with**: ch03-sc08 shows ground-level impact; this shows leadership decision

**Purpose**:
- Show moment when Veltri's "support" became "control"
- Establish Amara's complicity (she trusted Veltri, signed off)
- Create tragic irony: ch03-sc08 shows Nia experiencing consequences of THIS decision
- Establish "small heat behind the eyes" = knowing something's wrong but doing it anyway

**Structure**:
- **Opening**: Veltri's lab, years ago, reviewing Pearl Clinic stress test
- **Middle**: Amara younger, less experienced, trusting Veltri's expertise
- **Key moment**: Decision to clamp variance "temporarily" for "optics"
- **Amara's choice**: Signs off, believing it's right call
- **Veltri's tell**: "Small heat behind the eyes" - she knows this is wrong
- **Closing**: "They called it scaffolding. The board called it acceptable."

**Connections**:
- Nia's deputy (ch03-sc08) = following THEIR guidance
- "ACCEPTABLE VARIANCE" overlay (ch03-sc08) = THIS decision
- Veltri's present control = continuation of pattern started here
- Amara's arc = confronting her own complicity

**Target Length**: 1,000-1,200 words (not 1,500—tighter is better)

**Key Dialogue/Moments**:
```
"It's temporary," Veltri said, but her hands moved through the data with
the precision of someone making something permanent. "Just until the board
sees our baseline results."

Amara was younger then. Still learning to read the space between what
systems said and what they meant. "The pediatric wing can handle the
variance reduction?"

"Define 'handle.'" Veltri's smile didn't reach her eyes. "The numbers will
stabilize. The optics will improve. The children will adapt."

That small heat behind Veltri's eyes—Amara would learn to recognize it
years later. The look of someone who knows they're crossing a line but has
already decided the crossing is worth it.

"I'll sign off," Amara said, because she trusted her mentor. Because the
data looked sound. Because she didn't yet understand that perfect numbers
could describe a failing system.

Later, she would learn that Deputy—Veltri's deputy—implemented the clamp
exactly as designed. That a nurse tied knots on a handrail. That someone
named Nia stole windows in the logging intervals just to let the room breathe.

But that morning, Amara signed her name on the authorization and thought
she was doing the right thing.

They called it scaffolding, that day. Temporary support for vulnerable systems.

The board called it acceptable.

The children just called it the day the room got colder.
```

**Words**: 1,000-1,200

---

**PHASE 2 TOTAL**: ~1,100 words (estimated)

---

## Phase 3: Author Decision Required

### Gray-Zone Vignettes (Optional)

**Concept**: Ground-level POV showing human impact of policy decisions

**NEW SCENE 1**: ch07-interlude-tenebra.md
**Length**: ~400 words
**POV**: Tenebra pediatric aide (Kira)
**Content**: Learning knot code, first time air listens
**Opening**: "We called it 'all's well' because the chart never did. My hands learned the knots before my mouth learned the policy."

**NEW SCENE 2**: ch10-interlude-tenebra-payoff.md
**Length**: ~400 words
**POV**: Same aide
**Content**: Holding window during transformation; "we kept breathing" beat
**Connection**: Asha mentions Kira in council scene; ties to Nia flashback

**Total**: ~800 words

**Author Decision Criteria**:
- Are these **earned** (set up by earlier scenes)?
- Are they **necessary** (do they add missing human stakes)?
- Do they **add to aesthetic** (deepen emotional experience)?

**Questions to Consider**:
1. Do existing scenes (Arc-9 crisis, Asha's reports, Nia flashbacks) already provide sufficient ground-level stakes?
2. Would 2 new POV vignettes fragment narrative or deepen it?
3. Are 800 words better spent here or expanding existing scenes?

**If YES**: Include both vignettes, connect to Asha/Nia
**If NO**: Cut these, use words to expand existing scenes

## Items Dropped from Original Plan

Based on critique analysis and author feedback:

❌ **Insert #1: Hidden Garden Veltri Tell**
- **Reason**: Redundant with existing Solace dampeners mention (ch03-sc01:41)
- **Alternative**: Can add "tagged in Veltri's narrow serif" to existing dampener line if font detail wanted

❌ **Insert #2: Serra Fabric/Policy Additions**
- **Reason**: Fabric is cultural memory (per author), not technical tool; adding detector function would retrofit
- **Alternative**: None needed—scene already has Veltri-Serra history

❌ **Insert #3: Wind Tribes Storm-Lift**
- **Reason**: Redundant with existing "drones moved like birds" / "learning to mimic" (ch05-sc02:30-32)
- **Alternative**: Only add if "storm-lift" needed as recurring technical term in later chapters
- **If needed**: Place BEFORE "moved like birds" line as terminology setup (~25 words)

❌ **Insert #6: Brightline Corridor**
- **Reason**: Cannot locate scene; "Brightline pilot setup" doesn't exist in current structure

❌ **Plateau Bivouac Scene**
- **Reason**: Not necessary; existing prep scene (ch05-sc06) provides pre-vote beat
- **Alternative**: None needed

❌ **Wind Tribunal Scene**
- **Reason**: Author confirmed this should be dropped (oversight, contradicts "no new subplots")

---

## Hand-Offs: Integrated Approach

**Original plan**: Explicit "deliverables in hand" language at end of faction scenes

**Revised approach**: Trust reader inference; use thematic closure

**What's Already There**:
- ch03-sc03 ends with "show them everything" + Network preparing
- ch05-sc03 ends with "growing in ways they can't predict"
- Each faction scene has forward momentum

**What We're Adding**:
- Memory Garden evidence setup (Phase 1, Insert #1)
- Clock tethers for temporal clarity (Phase 1, Insert #2)

**Result**: Causality is clear without mechanical "deliverable" language

## Timeline Consistency Check

Using timeline.md as reference:

| Scene Being Modified | Timeline Position | Addition | Consistency Check |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| ch03-sc03 | Day 1, Afternoon | Evidence setup + clock tether | ✅ "Vote comes at dawn" = Day 3 dawn, consistent |
| ch05-sc02 | Day 2, Evening/Night | Clock tether | ✅ "Before dawn" = Day 3 dawn, consistent |
| ch06-sc02 | Day 3, Morning | Evidence payoff | ✅ Vote day, using gathered evidence |
| ch03-sc09 (new) | FLASHBACK (years ago) | Veltri flashback | ✅ Placed after ch03-sc08 (also flashback) |
| ch07-interlude (new) | Post-Vote Day 1 | Optional vignette | ✅ Implementation day, ground-level view |
| ch10-interlude (new) | Post-Vote, Later | Optional vignette | ✅ Payoff during transformation |

**All additions consistent with timeline.md**

---

## Style Guidelines

**Every addition must**:
1. Match existing lyrical, organic voice
2. Trust reader inference (show, don't explain)
3. Use sensory/thematic language over technical catalog
4. Read as if it was always there

**Before adding ANY text**:
- Read target scene aloud
- Match rhythm and tone
- Cut half of any explanation
- Test integration by reading full scene with addition

**Example of voice consistency**:

❌ **Over-explained**:
```
"By the east manifold, a Solace-grade calibration bracket—wrong alloy,
right angles—sat tagged TEMPORARY—MONITOR in a font Amara knew too well."
```

✅ **Trusting inference**:
```
"Solace dampeners, tagged in Veltri's narrow serif, arrested evolution by
forcing stable baselines..."
```

## Next Steps After This Plan

**Acknowledge**: This plan addresses ~1,200-2,000 words of ~15k gap

**Phase 2 Strategy Needed For**:
- Remaining ~13k words to reach 90k target
- Different approach: likely scene expansion rather than addition
- Focus areas:
  - Deepen faction visits (currently compressed)
  - Expand post-vote transformation (Ch7-12)
  - Add sensory detail, emotional beats
  - Transitional scenes between chapters

**Recommend**: Complete this plan first, then assess what story needs for expansion

---

## Summary

**What This Plan Does**:
- ✅ Adds missing causality (Memory Garden → Council)
- ✅ Clarifies timeline (selective clock tethers)
- ✅ Completes Veltri arc (flashback showing pivot moment)
- ✅ Maintains voice and reader trust
- ✅ Minimal, high-value additions

**What This Plan Doesn't Do**:
- ❌ Reach 90k word count (addresses ~9-14% of gap)
- ❌ Expand existing scenes
- ❌ Add transitional material
- ❌ Deepen faction sequences

**Total Word Count Impact**:
- Phase 1: ~95 words
- Phase 2: ~1,100 words
- Phase 3 (optional): ~800 words
- **Total**: ~1,200-2,000 words (depending on Phase 3 decision)

**Total Implementation Time**:
- Phase 1: 1-2 hours
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours
- Phase 3 (if included): 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 5-8 hours
