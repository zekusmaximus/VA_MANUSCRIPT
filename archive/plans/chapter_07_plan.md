# Chapter 7 Plan — NEW GROWTH (Climax, Part 2)

- POV: Amara only
- Function: Execute catalytic act; show costs; depict the earned turn from containment → learning; Veltri recognition without conversion.
- Status: Modified/Redesigned

## Scene Beats

1) Convergence Impact — All Is Lost [MOD]
- Goal: Survive dampener wave; prevent collapse.
- Conflict: Variance collapses in pockets; kids’ textiles dim; microgrids go dark.
- Turn: Children’s textiles + root nets rebound as “variance reservoirs,” routed through Amara’s fabric key channel.
- Outcome: First neighborhoods flip from containment to learning; proof of principle.

2) Allies Buy Time — Cost of Growth [NEW]
- Goal: Keep channel stable while learning propagates.
- Conflict: Nia (injured) retunes botanics; Jin draws drones; Ravi’s earlier cut forces manual reroutes by others.
- Turn: Pattern reaches Helios controllers (via stolen baselines); Helios mirrors learning curve, stops serving as dampener hub.
- Outcome: Dampener network loses dominance; learning state self-reinforces.

3) Lab Confrontation 2 — Recognition Without Conversion [MOD]
- Goal: Close personal arc with Veltri.
- Conflict: She fears fragility at scale.
- Turn: Acknowledges resilience > control here-and-now; stands down countermeasures.
- Outcome: Awe/regret; no instant ideological flip.

4) The Turn Lands — Pockets Free First [MOD]
- Goal: Show earned, local wins.
- Conflict: Transition jitter; handoff from Amara to city.
- Turn: Amara releases the channel; city sustains learning state.
- Outcome: Protagonist-caused, costly, pre-seeded victory.

## Continuity/Rules
- Keep all non-local action as terse comms/telemetry through Amara.
