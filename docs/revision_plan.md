Verdant Accord — Revision Plan (v2)

Definition of Done

- All tasks in this plan are completed and verified in the referenced scenes/*.md files (no work in compiled text).
- Word count across scenes reaches 90,000+.

Plan Update (Targeted, Minimal Inserts)

- Tighten Act II‑B causality with explicit hand‑offs (Wind Tribes, Serra’s weave, Memory Garden) used in Ch10.
- Seed Veltri’s presence earlier via light, local tells (Hidden Garden, Serra’s arcology, Wind Tribes).
- Add “clock tethers” (vote at dawn / fast‑tracked today) to keep tension present.
- Keep Wind Tribes aligned; no new subplots.
- Add optional vignettes + flashback as separate scene files (4–6k total across Act II‑B + Ch10).

Surgical Inserts (Exact Sentences + Targets)

1) Hidden Garden (seed Veltri tell)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert after: “The Network’s central chamber was a forest turned inside out…”
- Insert:
  - “By the east manifold, a Solace‑grade calibration bracket—wrong alloy, right angles—sat tagged TEMPORARY—MONITOR in a font Amara knew too well.”
  - Clock tether (same beat, end of para): “The council had pulled the vote to dawn; everything we found here had hours to matter.”

2) Serra’s arcology (seed Veltri tell + too‑clean log detector preview)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert after: “Serra. Welcome to my life’s work, Engineer Solis.”
- Insert:
  - “Pinned by the loom, a palm‑sized policy card read like a template: ‘ standardize to stabilize; log variance as optics,’ the cadence so perfect Amara would hear it again in council language.”
- At hand‑off (when Serra gives the fabric square), replace/add one line after “For the council… And for you.”
  - “This weave carries a variance reservoir—and a ‘too‑clean log’ tell; if a corridor reads motionless at noon, someone’s gaming optics. Walk it into the chamber.”
- Clock tether (end of scene): “Dawn’s vote wouldn’t wait; we’d bring cloth, and proof, to a room that loved clean lines.”

3) Wind Tribes (seed Veltri tell + hand‑off)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert in drones sequence after: “These moved like birds themselves…”
- Insert (Zara/Kevin observation): “That path rides storm‑lift arcs too cleanly for chance,” Zara said, watching a drone trace a biomimetic curve it could only have learned from us.
- Hand‑off line (end of High Garden/air corridor prep): “We leave with two things we’ll need before dawn: the five‑beat window for altitude air, and Zara’s beacon route stitched into our map.”

4) Memory Garden (tighten to single exhibit set used in council)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert after: “The Memory Garden’s flowers pulsed with centuries of human experience…”
- Insert:
  - “Pull the before/after telemetry from New Singapore and Rio,” Amara said. “Tag them Exhibit A and B for the council proofs—one living, one standardized—no tour, just consequence.”
  - Clock tether (same block): “They’d fast‑tracked the vote to today; our exhibits had to be sharp enough to cut.”

5) Council proofs (explicit use of exhibits)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert during chamber sequence, before Amara rebuts Veltri:
- Insert:
  - “Project Exhibits A/B,” Amara told the wall—New Singapore pre/post variance, Rio before/after clamp—‘growth that breathes’ versus ‘stability that starves.’”

6) Closet‑clamp foreshadow (Serra’s tool)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert in Brightline pilot setup (first corridor visit), just before the window opens:
- Insert:
  - “Ravi clipped Serra’s ‘too‑clean log’ tell to the feed—if the corridor ever read motionless at noon, it would flag as fraud, not comfort.”

7) Clock tethers (add 1–2 lines to each faction scene)

- Wind Tribes scenes (end of segment): “Vote’s at dawn; storms won’t wait and neither will the chamber.”
- Serra scenes (end of segment): “Fast‑tracked to today; fabric and findings go straight to the floor.”
- Memory Garden scenes (end of segment): “Hours left; Exhibits A/B go live on entry.”

Hand‑Off Lines (End Each Faction Scene)

- Wind Tribes: “Five‑beat window logged, beacons aligned—deliverables in hand before dawn.”
- Serra’s Weave: “Variance key and ‘too‑clean’ detector loaded; we’ll prove this in the room.”
- Memory Garden: “Exhibits A/B exported; we’ll speak in telemetry, not faith.”

Expansion Options (New Scene Files + Tight Loglines)

Gray‑zone POV vignettes (recurring)

- scenes/ch07-sc08-gray-window.md (200–300 words): Tenebra pediatric aide learns knot code; hates “perfect” numbers; first time the air listens.
  - Opening: “We called it ‘all’s well’ because the chart never did. My hands learned the knots before my mouth learned the policy.”
- scenes/ch09-sc08-gray-window.md (250–350 words): Montage echoes—child sleeps, fewer grumbles, knot logged; stakes sharpen as clamps creep.
  - Opening: “The rail had a memory now. It met my fingers like it recognized the count.”
- scenes/ch10-sc00-gray-window-payoff.md (250–400 words, intercut in chorus/seed run): “we kept breathing” beat as concierge/aide hold window during wave; ledger note lands.
  - Opening: “Three on, two off—we matched the city, and for once it matched us back.”

Veltri flashback (Amara POV)

- scenes/ch03-sc10-trellis-stress-test.md (1.0–1.5k): Early ward incident (Pearl): trellis rhetoric bends into optics‑driven clamp; Amara signs off on a ‘temporary’ hold; the first “small heat behind the eyes.”
  - Hook line: “We called it scaffolding the day the lights went flat. The board called it acceptable.”

Quiet bridge (pre‑High Garden)

- scenes/ch10-sc00-plateau-bivouac.md (400–600 words): rope practice, beacons, “what do we leave behind if we must?” talk; soft clock tether to dawn.

Optional internal conflict (Wind Tribunal)

- scenes/ch10-sc01a-wind-tribunal.md (500–700 words): Elder’s condition: plateau towns get watcher training; Amara agrees; Kevin drafts a 2‑page protocol; ends on hand‑off: “five‑beat window + watchers go in the same bag.”

Total optional lift: ~4.0–6.0k across Act II‑B + Ch10.

Additional Exact Inserts (Subtle Veltri Seep)

Hidden Garden sweep (early)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert: “Someone had slotted a Solace calibration panel into a living manifold and labeled it benign—TEMPORARY, MONITOR—the way you excuse a bruise.”

Serra policy cadence (echo in council)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert: “The phrasing—‘stabilize first, standardize later’—would resurface in council templates like a watermark.”

Wind drones (learned storm‑lift)

- SCENE TO AMEND: docs/THE_VERDANT_ACCORD_COMPILED_CLEAN_v2.md
- Insert: “That curvature isn’t guesswork,” Kevin said. “They stole it from our last storm.”

Where These Land (Anchors)

- Hidden Garden inserts: Chapter 3 “The Verdant Network”—first walkthrough of the living center (after chamber reveal; before corporate drone alert).
- Serra inserts: Chapter 5 “Fractured Alliances”—weaving hall tour and fabric hand‑off.
- Wind Tribe inserts: Chapter 5 “The drones came at sunset…” block and High Garden preparation.
- Memory Garden exhibit line: Chapter 3 “The Memory Garden…” first major data pull.
- Council exhibit use: Chapter 6 “The Corporate Agenda”—chamber sequence where displays shift.

Notes on Style + Pace

- Keep inserts to one sentence wherever possible; add clock tethers as end‑caps.
- End every faction scene with a hand‑off line that names the deliverable moving toward the heist/vote.
- Maintain Wind Tribes as aligned; no extra complications beyond learned storm‑lift line.
