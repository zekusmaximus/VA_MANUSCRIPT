## 2. Query Letter Strategy

### Choosing Your Version

**Version 1 (Standard)** - Use if:
- You're new to querying
- Agent prefers traditional format
- You want the safest, most professional approach

**Version 2 (Hook-Forward)** - Use if:
- You want to stand out in slush pile
- Agent's MSWL mentions unique premises
- You're comfortable with bold opening

**Version 3 (Character-Driven)** - Use if:
- Agent represents emotional, character-focused SFF
- Agent's client list includes books with strong internal conflict
- You want to emphasize Amara's personal journey

### Personalization Is Critical

**Research each agent:**
1. Check their #MSWL (manuscript wish list)
2. Read their interviews/blog posts
3. Look at their recent sales (Publishers Marketplace)
4. Review their client list
5. Note their submission preferences

**Personalization examples:**
- "I'm querying you because you represented [TITLE] and mentioned loving infrastructure-as-character in your interview with [SOURCE]."
- "Your #MSWL request for 'hopepunk with teeth' describes THE VERDANT ACCORD perfectly."
- "I saw you're looking for optimistic SFF that doesn't shy from systemic critique, which resonates with my novel's core."

**Never send generic queries.** Agents can tell.

## 3. Comparable Titles (Comps)

### The Comp Formula

**Your book = [Comp A] meets [Comp B]**
Or: **Your book will appeal to readers who loved [Comp A] and [Comp B]**

### Suggested Comps

**Strong matches:**
1. **A PSALM FOR THE WILD-BUILT** by Becky Chambers (2021)
   - Why: Gentle eco-tech, hopeful tone, human-technology relationship
   - Similar: Optimistic worldbuilding, focus on care/community

2. **THE TERRAFORMERS** by Annalee Newitz (2023)
   - Why: Systems-level conflict, ideological stakes, eco-focus
   - Similar: Corporate vs. organic growth, transforming landscapes

**Alternative Comps (research before using):**
3. **THE MOUNTAIN IN THE SEA** by Ray Nayler (2022)
   - Why: Consciousness in non-human systems, ethical tech questions
   - Different: More philosophical, less community-focused

4. **A HALF-BUILT GARDEN** by Ruthanna Emrys (2022)
   - Why: Community governance, eco-optimism, systems thinking
   - Similar: Grassroots innovation, hopeful solarpunk

5. **LIGHT FROM UNCOMMON STARS** by Ryka Aoki (2021)
   - Why: Community care, marginalized perspectives, optimism with stakes
   - Different: Contemporary fantasy elements

**Comp Selection Rules:**
- Published in last 2-3 years (2021-2024 ideal)
- Not mega-bestsellers (avoid Hunger Games, Harry Potter, etc.)
- Similar in tone, audience, or theme (doesn't need to match plot)
- Successful but not too successful (agents want to see market awareness)
- Actually read them (or at least be familiar enough to discuss)

### Research Your Comps

**Before finalizing, check:**
- Publication date
- Sales performance (not too big, not too small)
- Genre category (adult SFF, not YA)
- Agent representation (who repped it?)
- Reader reviews (does audience align with your target?)

**Resources:**
- Goodreads
- Publishers Marketplace
- QueryTracker
- Agent websites/social media

## 4. Target Agent List

### Build Your List (Before Querying)

**Criteria for agents:**
1. Actively seeking adult science fiction
2. Open to submissions (check agency website)
3. Recent sales in hopepunk/solarpunk/eco-SFF
4. Track record of debut authors
5. Reputable (check Preditors & Editors, QueryTracker)

**Research Sources:**
- **QueryTracker** - Agent database with stats
- **Manuscript Wish List** - #MSWL on Twitter/website
- **Publishers Marketplace** - See recent deals
- **Acknowledgments pages** - Check books you comp to
- **Agent websites** - Read their about pages
- **Twitter/social media** - Follow agents who rep SFF

**List Size:** Aim for 50-100 agents initially

### Prioritize Your List

**Tier 1 (Dream agents):** Perfect fit, strong track record, dream clients
**Tier 2 (Strong matches):** Good fit, solid reputation, relevant sales
**Tier 3 (Solid options):** Accepts genre, open to queries, less established

---

## 5. Querying Strategy

### Batch Querying

**Don't query everyone at once.** Test your materials first.

**Batch 1 (5-10 queries):**
- Send to Tier 2-3 agents (save dream agents)
- Wait 4-6 weeks
- Track response rate

**Evaluate results:**
- Multiple requests? Materials are strong - proceed
- Some requests? Materials are decent - maybe revise query
- No response? Revise query before next batch

**Batch 2 (10-15 queries):**
- Include revised query (if needed)
- Mix of Tier 2-3 agents
- Wait 4-6 weeks

**Batch 3+ (15-20 queries):**
- Include Tier 1 dream agents
- Send when confident in materials

### Timeline Expectations

- **Query response:** 2-8 weeks (some never respond)
- **Partial request:** Agent wants first 50 pages
- **Full request:** Agent wants full manuscript
- **Response to full:** 4-12 weeks (can be longer)
- **Offer:** When agent wants to represent you

**Industry norm:** Many agents don't respond to queries unless interested ("no response means no")

### Tracking Your Queries

Use a spreadsheet:

| Agent Name | Agency | Date Sent | Response Date | Result | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Jane Smith | ABC Literary | 01/15/24 | 02/01/24 | Rejected | "Liked premise but not passionate" |
| John Doe | XYZ Agency | 01/15/24 | - | No response | 8 weeks, assume no |
| Alice Johnson | DEF Agency | 01/20/24 | 01/25/24 | Request full | Fast response! |

## 6. When You Get Requests

### Partial Request (First 50 pages)

**Response time:** Within 24-48 hours
1. Thank them professionally
2. Attach formatted pages as requested (usually PDF or Word)
3. Keep it brief - no need to re-pitch
4. Continue querying others

**Email template:**
```
Dear [Agent Name],

Thank you for your interest in THE VERDANT ACCORD. I've attached the first 50 pages as requested.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Full Request

**Response time:** Within 24-48 hours
1. Same professional response
2. Attach full manuscript (formatted)
3. Mention any competing interest (if you have other fulls out)
4. Continue querying

**If you have multiple fulls out:**
"Thank you for your request. I should mention that the full manuscript is also under consideration at [Agency Name], though I have not yet received an offer of representation."

### The Offer Call

**When an agent offers representation:**

1. **Thank them and ask for time:** "Thank you so much! May I have a week to consider?"
2. **Notify other agents with your full:** "I've received an offer of representation and wanted to let you know, as you have my full manuscript."
3. **Prepare questions for the call** (see below)
4. **Make your decision within agreed timeframe**

**Questions to ask:**
- What is your vision for this book?
- What revisions do you anticipate?
- What publishers would you submit to?
- What's your submission strategy and timeline?
- How do you communicate with clients?
- What are your commission rates? (Standard is 15% domestic, 20% foreign)
- Can I speak with some of your current clients?
- Do you have a foreign rights team/film agent?

## 7. Red Flags to Avoid

### Legitimate Agents Never:
- Charge reading fees
- Require editing services before representation
- Ask for money upfront for any reason
- Guarantee publication
- Pressure you to sign immediately

### Warning Signs:
- No recent sales listed
- Can't find them on QueryTracker or Publishers Marketplace
- Generic website with multiple businesses
- Poor grammar in communications
- Offer representation after only seeing query (not reading manuscript)

### Verify Legitimacy:
- Check Association of Authors' Representatives (AAR) membership
- Look up sales on Publishers Marketplace
- Search "[Agent Name] + scam" or "warning"
- Check Preditors & Editors
- Read QueryTracker comments

---

## 8. Professional Communication

### Email Etiquette

**Subject lines:**
- Query: "Query: THE VERDANT ACCORD - Adult SFF"
- Response to request: "Requested Material: THE VERDANT ACCORD"

**Tone:**
- Professional but personable
- Proofread obsessively
- No emojis or casual language
- Keep it brief

**Response times:**
- To agent requests: 24-48 hours
- To agent questions: Same business day if possible
- Never: "Sorry for the delay" (unless it's been weeks)

### What Not to Do

- ❌ Don't query agents who don't represent your genre
- ❌ Don't send unsolicited full manuscripts
- ❌ Don't nudge before their stated response time
- ❌ Don't argue with rejection feedback
- ❌ Don't bad-mouth other agents/publishers
- ❌ Don't lie about competing offers
- ❌ Don't overshare personal information
- ❌ Don't apologize for querying them

---

## 9. Rejection & Persistence

### Types of Rejections

**Form rejection:** Standard "not right for my list"
- Don't take personally
- Most common type
- Learn nothing from it

**Personal rejection:** Specific feedback
- Gold! Save and analyze
- Agent saw potential
- Use feedback to revise

**Request then rejection:** They read pages/full
- Still meaningful interest
- Get feedback if offered
- Could be subjective, not quality

### When to Revise

**Revise query if:**
- Zero requests after 20-30 queries
- Multiple agents say same thing about query
- You realize you didn't convey the story clearly

**Revise manuscript if:**
- Multiple agents cite same issue in pages
- You get requests but all reject after reading
- Trusted beta readers identify major problems

**Don't revise if:**
- Only a few rejections
- Feedback is contradictory
- It's purely subjective taste

### Keep Going

- **Industry average:** 50-100 queries before finding agent
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months is normal
- **Success stories exist:** Many debuts found agents after 100+ queries
- **Multiple books:** Many authors land agents on book 2 or 3

**"A rejection is just one person's opinion on one day."**

## 10. While You Query

### Stay Productive

1. **Start your next book** - Best use of time
2. **Connect with writing community** - Twitter, writing groups
3. **Keep learning** - Craft books, workshops, conferences
4. **Build platform** - Website, social media (but don't obsess)
5. **Read widely** - Especially in your genre

### Don't:
- Obsessively check email
