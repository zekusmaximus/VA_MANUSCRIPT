## TEMPORAL ANALYSIS NOTES

### Ambiguities and Strategic Interpretations

1. **Vote Timeline Shift (Ch3)**: Scene 3-01 states vote was "fast-tracked to today," but later chapters show vote happens at dawn of Day 3. **Strategic interpretation**: The vote was initially scheduled for Day 1 ("today"), but corporate advance and Network preparation caused postponement to Day 3 dawn. The text compresses this, creating some confusion.

2. **Chapter 8 Structure**: Listed as 5 scenes but reads as one extended scene (804 words total) covering dawn → evening. **Strategic interpretation**: Thematic scene breaks rather than temporal breaks.

3. **Time Gap Before Chapter 9**: Text implies significant passage of time (other cities transforming). **Strategic interpretation**: Days or weeks have passed, sufficient for global communication networks to establish and other cities to begin their own transformations.

4. **Chapter 10 Brevity**: Very short chapter (541 words in sc01) serving as threshold. **Strategic interpretation**: This is a pivotal moment compressed in time - a single morning where paradox is encountered, serving as narrative hinge between expansion (Ch9) and deep integration (Ch11).

5. **Chapter 12 Vision Extension**: Final scene extends beyond linear time. **Strategic interpretation**: The narrative transcends chronological time to show the transformation's ongoing nature and endless future growth.

### Scene Count
- **Total Scenes**: 78 scenes across 12 chapters
- **Main Narrative**: 76 present-timeline scenes
- **Flashbacks**: 2 historical scenes (ch03-sc08, ch05-sc08)

### Time Span
- **Main Story (Ch1-6)**: ~3-4 days
- **Transformation Period (Ch7-12)**: ~5-7 days of narrative time (plus implied weeks for global expansion)
- **Total Linear Time**: ~2 weeks to several weeks
- **Historical Flashbacks**: Years before main story
