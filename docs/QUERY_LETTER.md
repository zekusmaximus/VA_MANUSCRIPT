# Query Letter for THE VERDANT ACCORD

---

## Version 1: Standard Format

Dear [Agent Name],

Amara Solis taught Luminara's living grid to breathe—heliotropic arrays that learn the sun, neural networks that grow like roots, infrastructure that loves its people back. But when she discovers a heartbeat-like anomaly in the city's power flow, she realizes someone is teaching her creation a new rhythm. Someone who knows exactly how she thinks.

That someone is Dr. Elara Veltri, Amara's former mentor and the visionary who turned Luminara from blueprint to breathing city. Now Veltri works for Solace Industries, and she's mapping every unofficial network, every community innovation, every adaptation that grew in the margins where corporate systems didn't reach. Her plan: replace organic evolution with "scaffolding for growth"—a regime of optimized control justified by an ideology of "acceptable variance" that rounds whole neighborhoods to zero. Amara built the thresholds that made those people invisible. Now she has to decide: protect the system she designed, or join the Wasteland rebels she dismissed as primitive to prove that messy, adaptive, human infrastructure is stronger than any algorithm.

THE VERDANT ACCORD is an adult science fiction novel complete at 89,000 words. It will appeal to readers who loved the community-focused eco-tech of Becky Chambers' A PSALM FOR THE WILD-BUILT and the ideological conflict of Annalee Newitz's THE TERRAFORMERS. It is a hopeful exploration of what cities become when we build them to grow alongside the people who live in them, rather than despite them.

## Version 2: Hook-Forward (More Aggressive)

Dear [Agent Name],

In Luminara, the infrastructure doesn't just work—it cares. Solar arrays that learn the sun like living things. Neural grids that adapt to human need. A city that breathes.

Amara Solis spent seven years teaching these systems to love people back. Then she discovered someone was rewriting their heartbeat.

Dr. Elara Veltri, Amara's former mentor, is mapping every organic network in the city—the community microgrids, the Wasteland innovations, the unofficial systems that make corporate infrastructure humane. For Solace Industries, Veltri is preparing to replace adaptation with control, evolution with "scaffolding," messy resilience with optimized obedience. Her ideology of "acceptable variance" has already made neighborhoods invisible in Amara's own code. Now it's about to make them obsolete.

Amara must choose: defend the brilliant systems she built, or ally with the Wasteland rebels she dismissed as backward to prove that technology that grows with people is stronger than technology that manages them. The stakes are a city's soul—and the future of what infrastructure can become.

THE VERDANT ACCORD is an adult science fiction novel complete at 89,000 words, combining the eco-tech optimism of Becky Chambers' A PSALM FOR THE WILD-BUILT with the systems-level conflict of Annalee Newitz's THE TERRAFORMERS. It is solarpunk with teeth: a story about the radical act of building cities that listen.

## Version 3: Character-Driven (Emphasis on Emotional Stakes)

Dear [Agent Name],

Amara Solis built Luminara to be loved. Its living grid learns like neurons. Its solar arrays track the sun like flowers. Its systems remember the people who tend them. For seven years, she's been teaching infrastructure to care.

Then she found the heartbeat.

Someone is rewriting the city's organic networks—replacing adaptation with rigid control, evolution with "scaffolding." The anomalies trace back to Dr. Elara Veltri, Amara's mentor, now working for Solace Industries to "optimize" Luminara by flattening everything that won't submit to a metronome. Veltri's ideology erases communities that fall below "acceptable variance." Amara wrote those thresholds. She made whole neighborhoods invisible.

To stop Veltri, Amara must seek help from the Wasteland settlements—the people her beautiful city left behind. Kevin, their representative, built thriving systems from her discarded designs, proving that necessity teaches faster than optimization. Earning his trust means admitting her complicity. Fighting for the city means betraying everything she thought infrastructure should be.

THE VERDANT ACCORD (89,000 words, adult science fiction) asks: What if the systems we build could choose to grow wild? It combines the gentle eco-tech of Becky Chambers' A PSALM FOR THE WILD-BUILT with the ideological stakes of Annalee Newitz's THE TERRAFORMERS—hopepunk with institutional critique, solarpunk that doesn't look away from who gets left in the margins.

## Key Elements Checklist

**All versions include:**
- ✓ Opening hook (city that breathes/loves people back)
- ✓ Clear protagonist (Amara Solis, architect of living grid)
- ✓ Central conflict (mentor's plan to replace organic growth with control)
- ✓ Personal stakes (Amara's complicity, her code made people invisible)
- ✓ External stakes (city's future, what infrastructure becomes)
- ✓ Genre/word count/comp titles
- ✓ Target audience signals (hopepunk/solarpunk)

**Strategic Decisions:**

1. **Word Count:** Listed as 89,000 words (actual count from compiled manuscript)
2. **Genre:** Adult Science Fiction (not YA - protagonist is established professional)
3. **Subgenre signals:** Hopepunk, solarpunk (explicitly mentioned in Version 2-3)
4. **Comp titles suggested:**
   - A PSALM FOR THE WILD-BUILT by Becky Chambers (gentle eco-tech, community focus)
   - THE TERRAFORMERS by Annalee Newitz (systems-level conflict, ideological stakes)

   *Note: Research these or similar recent (2022-2024) SFF titles to ensure they're appropriate comps. Avoid mega-bestsellers.*

**Choose Your Version Based On:**

- **Version 1:** Most traditional/professional, safest choice, clear structure
- **Version 2:** Most aggressive hook, best for standing out in slush pile, emphasizes unique premise
- **Version 3:** Most emotional, best for agents who rep character-driven SFF, emphasizes personal stakes

- "Your #MSWL call for hopeful SFF with infrastructure-as-character resonated with my novel."
- "I saw your interview about wanting more solarpunk with teeth, which describes THE VERDANT ACCORD perfectly."

**Never generic-query. Always personalize.**
