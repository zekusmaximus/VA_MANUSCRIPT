The template moved faster than policy: NIA‑HANDS‑FORWARD on a hand‑drawn card; Variance Chorus (v0.9) that said three bodies, salt, and time could hold a garden steady. Someone had laminated it using the machine meant for cafeteria menus. It smelled like hot plastic and hope.

Tokyo tide room: three‑on, two‑off; leader sits if wounded; shawl warms; vent listens; buffer breathes into cloth and back to stairwell. The cadence holds because hands do. The photo they sent back showed a room with walls the color of aged paper, a vent cover marked with careful brush strokes, and a grandmother whose posture said she had outlived three certification regimes and would outlive this one too.

Wind Tribe addendum from altitude: five‑beat windows for storm air. Note in weather: your storms aren't ours; adopt if true; amend if not. The message arrived written on cloth in a dye that shifted between red and brown depending on how the light hit it. Altitude protocol encoded in thread before any tablet had power to fail.

Elena filed a ledger page with knot code in charcoal to the Ch6 template repo—proof for people who need ink to believe breath. Her fingers were gray with graphite dust. She did not wash them. Evidence mattered.

Nia edited v0.9: widen ±0.3s when ambient < 18°C; if bio‑layer mislabels listening as fault, hide the metronome in housekeeping ≤ 60s/hr, never twice in an hour. "Teach the memory," she told Amara, voice steady despite the fact that she was rewriting guidelines faster than most boards could read them. "They don't need the why to save the breath."

A courier from the Wind Tribe sent a photo of a child’s wrist with a string tied in five small knots. “Windows for storms,” the caption said. “We remember even when the boards forget.” In the clip that followed, the elder who tied it showed a teenager how to listen for the gust between gusts. “Leave a place for wind to go,” she said, and the teenager nodded with the concentration of someone being handed a name.

In Tokyo, the tide-reader laughed when the metronome on a borrowed tablet froze and then rebooted into apology. “We don’t need your perfect clock,” she told it. “We have a wall.” She tapped the vent with two fingers—three, two—and the boy beside her matched her without looking up from the tea he was pouring for a patient.

Elena's inbox filled with small proofs: a page torn from a maintenance log repurposed as a watcher's ledger, the pencil marks so careful they looked like devotion; a photograph of a shawl that had been patched so many times its story looked like topography, each repair a different color thread telling a different shift; a note from housekeeping that said simply: we can do this without being told we are heroes. That one made her throat tight.

She printed the shawl photo and pinned it above her monitor. Not for inspiration—she was past needing that. For evidence that ordinary people could carry complexity in their hands when you gave them patterns that trusted their competence.

Nia watched as her handwriting—leader sits if wounded—traveled farther than she had. Someone in the coastal clinics had rewritten it in a script that curved like kelp, and someone in the plateau settlements had carved it into a wooden plaque that now hung in a common room where three shifts of watchers traded stories. For a beat she let the pride land and then she made it smaller so it would not get in the way of work.

"Version one point zero will have examples," she said aloud. "Not just rules. Boxes for numbers, space for human notes." She added a line to the template: write what the room taught you so the next hands can learn faster than you did. She underlined "you" twice.

Amara added a caution beneath that in a script the board would recognize: do not chase smooth lines; chasing increases risk of node burn with no gain in care. Ravi appended a small chart: probability of complaint drop versus drift tolerance, with a messy circle around the sweet spot that had more to do with tea and blankets than with math.

By the time the packet reached the coastal clinics, someone had already translated the guardrails into a language that used fewer numbers and more verbs. Sit. Breathe. Switch. Tie. Log. The verbs would carry when the tablets died or the power did its sulking trick. Amara opened the translation file and stared at how elegant it was—five words that could save a garden when the network went dark.

She copied them onto a card and taped it to the wall beside New Singapore's light-dreams. A rosetta stone made of other people's competence.

"Send the five-beat guidance to High Garden and mark it urgent," Nia said. "And put a line in the repo for people to ask questions without shame." Her voice cracked slightly on "shame." She'd been the person with questions once, before she learned to sound certain.

Elena typed: question box—no penalty for not knowing yet—and pinned it to the top. The first question came in before she'd finished formatting: how do I tell my crew this isn't busywork? Elena stared at it, then typed back: show them one person sleeping better. That's the whole argument.

Three more questions arrived before she closed the window. She let them sit unanswered for now—not out of neglect, but because she wanted Nia to see that other people were brave enough to ask.
