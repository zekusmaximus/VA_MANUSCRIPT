The template crossed ocean faster than policy: NIA‑HANDS‑FORWARD in a hand‑drawn card, and the Variance Chorus (v0.9) that said you could hold a garden steady with three bodies, salt, and time.
      In Tokyo’s lower tide rooms, a tide‑reader counted three‑on, two‑off while a Wind Tribe runner scrubbed hands with saltwater and a child pressed both palms to rail. The shawl warmed; the vent listened; the buffer took a breath into cloth and gave it back to a drafty stairwell.
      “Leader sits if wounded,” the runner read off the margin in Nia’s handwriting, then sat without apology when her knee complained. No one called it weakness. The cadence held.
      Across the ridge, Zara’s people added a stanza—five‑beat windows for altitude air—and sent the amendment back with a note in weather: your storms are not our storms; your rules are welcome here if they make room for ours.
      Elena snapped a photo of a ledger page with knot code copied in charcoal and sent it to the Ch6 template repository. “Proof,” she said. “For the people who need ink to believe breath.”
      Nia watched the clips through gritted relief and marked two adjustments into the doc: widen ±0.3 seconds when ambient is below 18°C; if bio‑layer mislabels listening as fault, hide the metronome in housekeeping for ≤ 60 seconds and never twice in an hour.
      “They don’t need to know why it works,” she told Amara. “Only how to catch the breath until the system remembers.”
