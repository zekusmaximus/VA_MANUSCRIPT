The Grid Control Center hummed like a hive coached into efficiency. Holographic displays drifted above workstations, blue light washing the living walls where engineered moss tasted the air and reported in chlorophyll. Amara's steps softened against recycled polymer flooring as she passed the night crew: few bodies, many eyes, a quiet rhythm of breath and keys.
      "Finally," Ravi called, not looking up. "I was about to send a drone to tug your sleeve."
      "I came as soon as I—" Amara stopped. Ravi had surrounded his station with ghosted windows—unofficial views into Sector 7's veins. "What is all this?"
      "Your anomalies?" Ravi gestured to the screens with one hand while typing with the other. "They're not random. Look at the pattern."
      Amara leaned in. The fluctuations from the observation deck resolved into a rhythm she knew in her body before her mind: "It reads like a heartbeat," she said.
      "Exactly." Ravi pulled up another layer. "Now watch with Solace's new security protocols overlaid. Last month's patch."
      The pattern slid and revealed regular hollows—clean transfers, not failures. "They're siphoning," Amara breathed. "But how? The neural mesh should block any unauthorized—"
"Unless the authorization is native," Ravi said, meeting her eye. "High‑level keys. Inside help."
      A thin chime threaded through the room. For four long heartbeats, street illumination, transit buffers, and waste‑heat reclaimers fell into the same rhythm, smoothing in phase—then snapped apart.
      "Did you see that?" Ravi scrubbed back the feed. "Cross‑stabilization spike."
      Amara checked the log. "Flagged as... UI glitch?" The entry sat gray and harmless: AUTOTUNE OVERRIDE: TEMPORARY HARMONY. DISMISSED.
      "Harmony shouldn't look like a mistake," she murmured.
      Amara's mind flinched toward Dr. Veltri—toward recent speeches about "investment in Luminara's future." Before she could say it aloud, a new alert cut across the monitors.
      "Speaking of Solace," Ravi muttered, "they're making themselves very present." He opened a permit notification. "Festival of Light sponsorship. Full access to the Helios Spiral's power systems for a 'demonstration.'"
      "The festival's tonight?" Amara had forgotten. Festival nights meant overtime—balancing the surges thousands of dancing bodies sent into the grid. "We should postpone. With these anomalies—"
      "Already tried." Ravi's mouth flattened. "Council overruled. Solace is very curious about our peak‑load behavior."
      One wall bloomed into the plaza feed: families gathering at the base of the Helios Spiral, crystalline ribs drinking the last sunlight and promising spectacle.
      "You should go," Ravi said.
      "What? I need to monitor—"
      "You need to see their demo up close." He lowered his voice. "Their permit's wrong. Power request lists ten times what the Spiral can harvest."
      Amara frowned. "Why would they—"
      "Exactly." Ravi turned back to the feeds. "I'll track the pattern here. Go find the part that won't show up on a dashboard."
      "I work better from here," Amara said. "The data—"
      "Sometimes you have to look past the data," Ravi said, softer. "And your old friend Kevin is running the demo. The Wastelands' rep will have thoughts about Solace borrowing the commons."
      Amara hesitated. She hadn't spoken to Kevin since their last council argument. His charges about uneven power access still stung—because she could not quite deny them.
      "Fine," she said. "Keep me on the pattern."
      "Alerts already routed." Ravi managed a small smile. "Try to enjoy some of it. It's still a festival."
      Amara nodded and moved. Behind her, the holograms kept their quiet choreography—a story of power and pacing most citizens would never read.
      Outside, evening felt charged. Crowds streamed plaza‑ward, bioluminescent fabrics blooming and fading as friends found one another by color. Children sprinted ahead, triggering path lights that answered with laughter‑bright pulses. The city stretched dusk into something generous.
      Amara's tablet told the truth beneath the glow. Sector 7's fluctuations climbed. Somewhere in the gathering, Solace prepared a demonstration that demanded the impossible.
      The Festival of Light was about to begin. Joy and caution met in her pulse.
