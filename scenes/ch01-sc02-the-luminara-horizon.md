The Grid Control Center hummed like a hive coached into efficiency, the sound not quite mechanical and not quite alive—somewhere in between, where good infrastructure lived. Holographic displays drifted above workstations like patient ghosts, blue light washing the living walls where engineered moss tasted the air and reported in chlorophyll—shifting from deep green when oxygen ran high to amber when CO2 climbed, a constant biometric that the night crew read without thinking. The air smelled green and slightly metallic, like a greenhouse married to a server room.

Amara's steps softened against recycled polymer flooring that gave slightly underfoot, designed to be kind to people who stood for twelve-hour shifts. She passed the night crew: few bodies, many eyes, a quiet rhythm of breath and keys and the occasional murmur into headsets. Most of them had worked here long enough that they moved through the space like it was an extension of their bodies—reaching for displays without looking, adjusting hologram angles with gestures so practiced they looked like dance. This was where Luminara thought about itself, where all the distributed intelligence of gardens and arrays and turbines came together into something that could be known.
      "Finally," Ravi called, not looking up. "I was about to send a drone to tug your sleeve."
      "I came as soon as I—" Amara stopped. Ravi had surrounded his station with ghosted windows—unofficial views into Sector 7's veins. "What is all this?"
      "Your anomalies?" Ravi gestured to the screens with one hand while typing with the other. "They're not random. Look at the pattern."
      Amara leaned in. The fluctuations from the observation deck resolved into a rhythm she knew in her body before her mind could name it. The graph pulsed: rise and fall, systole and diastole, the unmistakable cadence of something living. "It reads like a heartbeat," she said, and heard the wonder in her own voice despite the fear underneath.

"Exactly." Ravi pulled up another layer with a gesture that made the hologram bloom into three dimensions. "Now watch with Solace's new security protocols overlaid. Last month's patch—the one they said was routine maintenance."

The pattern shifted. What had looked like irregular fluctuation now revealed its architecture: regular hollows in the data stream, gaps that appeared and disappeared with the precision of a metronome. Clean transfers, not failures. Energy moving through the grid like water through a siphon, so smoothly you'd never notice unless you were looking for the rhythm underneath.

"They're siphoning," Amara breathed, her finger tracing one of the hollows. "But how? The neural mesh should block any unauthorized—"

"Unless the authorization is native," Ravi said, meeting her eye with the look that meant he'd been sitting on this realization for hours, checking and rechecking, hoping he was wrong. "High‑level keys. Inside help."
      A thin chime threaded through the room. For four long heartbeats, street illumination, transit buffers, and waste‑heat reclaimers fell into the same rhythm, smoothing in phase—then snapped apart.
      "Did you see that?" Ravi scrubbed back the feed. "Cross‑stabilization spike."
      Amara checked the log. "Flagged as... UI glitch?" The entry sat gray and harmless: AUTOTUNE OVERRIDE: TEMPORARY HARMONY. DISMISSED.
      "Harmony shouldn't look like a mistake," she murmured.
      Amara's mind flinched toward Dr. Veltri—toward recent speeches about "investment in Luminara's future" delivered with the kind of polished certainty that made people forget to ask what future meant or whose investment would define it. Before she could say the name aloud, a new alert cut across the monitors, red-flagged and marked with Council priority override.

"Speaking of Solace," Ravi muttered, pulling up the notification with the care you use when handling something that might bite, "they're making themselves very present." He opened the permit document and let Amara read it herself. "Festival of Light sponsorship. Full access to the Helios Spiral's power systems for a 'demonstration.'"

"The festival's tonight?" Amara had forgotten—easy to do when you spent your days inside the grid instead of in the city it powered. Festival nights meant overtime, meant balancing the surges that thousands of dancing bodies sent into the grid when their joy lit up their bioluminescent clothing all at once. The whole city would pulse like a heartbeat made visible. "We should postpone. With these anomalies—"

"Already tried." Ravi's mouth flattened into the expression he wore when politics overruled engineering. "Council overruled. Unanimous vote, actually. Solace is very curious about our peak‑load behavior, and apparently we're very eager to show them."
      One wall bloomed into the plaza feed: families gathering at the base of the Helios Spiral, crystalline ribs drinking the last sunlight and promising spectacle.
      "You should go," Ravi said.
      "What? I need to monitor—"
      "You need to see their demo up close." He lowered his voice. "Their permit's wrong. Power request lists ten times what the Spiral can harvest."
      Amara frowned. "Why would they—"
      "Exactly." Ravi turned back to the feeds. "I'll track the pattern here. Go find the part that won't show up on a dashboard."
      "I work better from here," Amara said, which was true but also easier. "The data—"

"Sometimes you have to look past the data," Ravi said, softer now, the voice he used when he was trying to tell you something important without making it sound like an order. "And your old friend Kevin is running the demo. The Wastelands' rep will have thoughts about Solace borrowing the commons."

Amara hesitated. She hadn't spoken to Kevin since their last council argument—three months ago, voices raised in a chamber that was supposed to be about consensus. His charges about uneven power access still stung because she could not quite deny them. Luminara's grid was built to share, yes, but it was also built with clear boundaries, and those boundaries had started to look more like walls when you were standing on the other side. Kevin had asked her directly: whose city is this? And she hadn't had an answer that didn't sound like an excuse.
      "Fine," she said. "Keep me on the pattern."
      "Alerts already routed." Ravi managed a small smile. "Try to enjoy some of it. It's still a festival."
      Amara nodded and moved. Behind her, the holograms kept their quiet choreography—a story of power and pacing most citizens would never read.
      Outside, evening felt charged—not just with anticipation but with literal current, the air humming faintly with all the systems ramping up for festival load. Crowds streamed plaza‑ward, bioluminescent fabrics blooming and fading as friends found one another by color. A group of teenagers wore shirts that cycled through the spectrum together, synchronized to some song only they could hear. Children sprinted ahead, triggering path lights that answered with laughter‑bright pulses, the city's infrastructure joining their game without being asked.

The city stretched dusk into something generous. Vendors set up carts along the main avenue, their goods lit by algae lamps that cast everything in warm amber—skewers of roasted vegetables from the vertical farms, cups of cold tea made from leaves grown in the tower gardens, small sculptures made from recycled polymer that caught the light and threw it back in unexpected colors. Someone played music on an instrument that looked like it was built from salvaged turbine parts, and the sound was bright and metallic and somehow right.

This was what Luminara was supposed to be: a city where technology made space for joy instead of demanding you trade one for the other. Amara felt the tug of it, the same pride she'd felt watching the arrays work, but tangled now with the knowledge that someone was using this beautiful system for purposes she couldn't yet name.

Amara's tablet told the truth beneath the glow. Sector 7's fluctuations climbed. Somewhere in the gathering, Solace prepared a demonstration that demanded the impossible.

The Festival of Light was about to begin. Joy and caution met in her pulse, and she couldn't tell which would win.
