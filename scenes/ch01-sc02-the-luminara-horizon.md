The Grid Control Center hummed with artificial life. Holographic displays floated at each workstation, their blue glow reflecting off the living walls where engineered moss monitored air quality. Amara's footsteps were silent on the recycled polymer floor as she made her way past empty desks. Night shift was always quiet, the skeleton crew focused on their screens.
      "Finally," Ravi called from his station, not looking up from his display. "I was about to send a drone after you."
      "I came as soon as I," Amara stopped short. Ravi's workstation was surrounded by unauthorized displays, each showing a different view of Sector 7's systems. "What is all this?"
      "Your anomalies?" Ravi gestured to the screens with one hand while typing with the other. "They're not random. Look at the pattern."
      Amara leaned in, studying the data streams. The fluctuations she'd noticed from the observation deck were clearer here, forming a rhythm that seemed almost... "It looks like a heartbeat," she said slowly.
      "Exactly." Ravi pulled up another display. "But watch what happens when I overlay the new security protocols Solace Industries installed last month."
      The pattern shifted, revealing regular gaps in the power flow. Not failures, transfers. "They're siphoning power," Amara breathed. "But how? The grid's neural networks should prevent any unauthorized "
      "Unless the authorization comes from inside the system." Ravi's dark eyes met hers. "Someone with high-level access is helping them."
      Amara's mind went to Dr. Veltri, to her mentor's recent enthusiasm about Solace's "investment in Luminara's future." But before she could voice the thought, a new alert flashed across the screens.
      "Speaking of Solace," Ravi muttered, "looks like they're making their presence known tonight." He pulled up a permit notification. "They're sponsoring the Festival of Light. Full access to the kinetic sculpture's power systems for their demonstration."
      "The festival's tonight?" Amara had forgotten. The annual celebration usually meant overtime in the control center, managing the power surges from thousands of people generating kinetic energy. "We should postpone it. With these anomalies "
      "Already tried." Ravi's expression was grim. "Council overruled me. Apparently, Solace's representatives are very interested in seeing how our power distribution handles peak load."
      A wall of screens showed the central plaza filling with people, families gathering around the base of the Helios Spiral. Its crystalline structure caught the last rays of sunlight, promising a spectacular show.
      "You should go," Ravi said suddenly.
      "What? I need to help monitor "
      "You need to watch their demonstration up close." He lowered his voice. "Something's wrong with their permit. Look at these power requirements they listed. They're requesting ten times the energy the sculpture could possibly generate."
      Amara frowned. "Why would they "
      "Exactly." Ravi turned back to his screens. "I'll keep tracking the anomalies from here. You go see what they're really planning."
      "I work better from here," Amara protested. "The data "
      "Sometimes you need to look beyond the data." Ravi's tone softened. "Besides, your old friend Kevin is running the demonstration. It might be worth hearing what the Wasteland representative has to say about Solace's sudden interest in public power systems."
      Amara hesitated. She hadn't spoken to Kevin since their last heated debate in the council chamber. His accusations about power inequality still stung, mostly because she couldn't entirely disagree with them.
      "Fine," she said finally. "But keep me updated on any changes in the pattern."
      "Already routing alerts to your tablet." Ravi managed a slight smile. "Try to enjoy yourself a little. It is a festival."
      Amara nodded, already heading for the door. Behind her, the holographic displays continued their dance of numbers and graphs, telling a story of power and control that most of Luminara's citizens would never see.
      Outside, the evening air was alive with excitement. Crowds streamed toward the central plaza, their clothes glowing with bioluminescent patterns. Children ran ahead of their parents, eager to reach the festivities. The city's automated lighting systems were adjusting to the sunset, creating the illusion of a gentle dusk that could last for hours.
      But Amara's tablet showed the truth behind the beautiful illusion. In Sector 7, the power fluctuations were growing stronger. And somewhere in the gathering crowd, Solace Industries was preparing a demonstration that required impossible amounts of energy.
      The Festival of Light was about to begin. And Amara had a feeling she wasn't going to enjoy it at all.
