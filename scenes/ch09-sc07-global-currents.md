"Clocks," Jin said, and the room stilled. Not silent—the ventilation still hummed, someone's tablet still chimed quietly with an incoming message—but the human noise stopped like someone had turned off a tap. Eight people, maybe nine, depending on whether you counted Riya who was technically in the corridor but listening through the open door.

Ravi posted the heartbeat window from New Singapore over the S7 capture and Helios cadence. "Land seed on exhale. Three‑on, two‑off. High Garden holds five at altitude." His voice was steady but his hands weren't. He gripped the edge of the table like it might slide away.

"Variance chorus v0.9 is out," Nia added. "Guardrails live. If we go thin, communities can hold botanics. Leader sits if wounded." She'd practiced that line. Amara could hear it in the way the words sat too neatly together, rehearsed until the fear didn't show.

"Route locked," Kevin said. "Beacons at first light. Keep off Solace air." He looked like he hadn't slept, which was probably true, but his eyes were clear. Ready.

Amara wrote one line at the bottom of the shared panel: windows are not faults. No one clapped. They exhaled together—an audible release, eight or nine people letting go of held breath at the same time—and the city caught it. Somewhere out there, in corridors and stairwells and pediatric coves, people were breathing in rhythm they'd learned from strangers. The thought made Amara's throat tight.

Ravi slid one more panel into view, a small table no one would remember in the story but everyone would need in the moment.

Window Readiness (abridged)
- Brightline Corridor: watchers trained; stipend forms pinned; CLOSET CLAMP drill completed
- Arc-9 Stair: tags stocked; teen scribe on shift; relay acceptable to burn if necessary
- Tenebra Pediatric: elder timekeeper assigned; tea and blankets staged; nurse briefed
- High Garden Bowl: five-beat ledger confirmed; beacons aligned; rope and thread packed

"Cost accounting?" Elena asked, and no one pretended she meant money. She meant what they would sacrifice, what they would risk, what could break if they got this wrong.

"We will lose one noncritical node," Ravi said, calm the way you get when you've already argued with yourself and lost in a way that felt like choosing. "But we log it and we learn. COST: ONE NODE. No more." He looked around the room, meeting eyes. "I've run the numbers sixteen times. This is the price. It's acceptable."

Acceptable. The word sat in the room like a stone in still water. No one argued with it, but no one celebrated it either. One node meant someone's corridor would run hotter for a few hours, meant a compressor working harder than it should, meant wear that would show up in maintenance logs months from now. Small costs. Real costs.

"Riya?" Amara asked without turning.

"On comms," Riya said from the corridor, her voice carrying through the open door with the specific authority of someone who'd decided what line they were willing to cross. "If a clamp tries to make theater, we will make room for breath. Temporary; monitor." No one thanked her. It wasn't the moment for thanks. It was the moment for acknowledgment, which Amara gave with a single nod that Riya couldn't see but probably felt.

Nia looked at her apprentices in the glass—their reflections overlaid on the window that showed the city starting to wake in pre-dawn gray. "If my interface drops," she said, "you carry the count." Three heads nodded like a metronome. "Say it back." Three voices did, in unison: "We carry the count." She'd taught them that. The steadiness, the certainty, the way you make a promise to a system that can't hear you but depends on you anyway.

Jin closed the deck. The screen went dark, taking the graphs and tables and careful annotations with it. What remained was just people in a room that smelled like old coffee and new fear.

The room stood up, not in ceremony but because their bodies had learned to move when the work arrived. No speeches. No last-minute pep talks. They had said what needed saying. Now they would do what needed doing.

On the way out, Amara tapped the line about windows with her knuckle—once, twice, a third time—a habit like a blessing. The knot someone had drawn in the margin looked suddenly less like art and more like a promise.

Kevin paused at the door, looked back at the dark screen, then at Amara. "First light," he said.

"First light," she confirmed. And then they were moving, scattering to their stations, carrying the heartbeat forward into Chapter Ten.
