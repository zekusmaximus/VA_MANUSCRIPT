"Clocks," Jin said, and the room stilled.
      Ravi posted the heartbeat window from New Singapore over the S7 capture and Helios cadence. "Land seed on exhale. Three‑on, two‑off. High Garden holds five at altitude."
      "Variance chorus v0.9 is out," Nia added. "Guardrails live. If we go thin, communities can hold botanics. Leader sits if wounded."
      "Route locked," Kevin said. "Beacons at first light. Keep off Solace air."
      Amara wrote one line at the bottom of the shared panel: windows are not faults. No one clapped. They exhaled together and the city caught the breath.

Ravi slid one more panel into view, a small table no one would remember in the story but everyone would need in the moment.

Window Readiness (abridged)
- Brightline Corridor: watchers trained; stipend forms pinned; CLOSET CLAMP drill completed
- Arc-9 Stair: tags stocked; teen scribe on shift; relay acceptable to burn if necessary
- Tenebra Pediatric: elder timekeeper assigned; tea and blankets staged; nurse briefed
- High Garden Bowl: five-beat ledger confirmed; beacons aligned; rope and thread packed

“Cost accounting?” Elena asked, and no one pretended she meant money.

“We will lose one noncritical node,” Ravi said, calm the way you get when you’ve already argued with yourself and lost in a way that felt like choosing. “But we log it and we learn. COST: ONE NODE. No more.”

“Riya?” Amara asked without turning.

“On comms,” Riya said from the corridor. “If a clamp tries to make theater, we will make room for breath. Temporary; monitor.” No one thanked her. It wasn’t the moment for thanks.

Nia looked at her apprentices in the glass. “If my interface drops,” she said, “you carry the count.” Three heads nodded like a metronome. “Say it back.” Three voices did.

Jin closed the deck. The room stood up, not in ceremony but because their bodies had learned to move when the work arrived. On the way out, Amara tapped the line about windows with her knuckle, a habit like a blessing. The knot someone had drawn in the margin looked suddenly less like art and more like a promise.
