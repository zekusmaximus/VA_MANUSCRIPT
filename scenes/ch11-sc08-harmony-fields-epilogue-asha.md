At Arc‑9 the night smelled of disinfectant and milk. Asha checked med warmers with the same hands she had used to learn the knot code when no one paid for knowing it.

She tied one for all’s well and two for heat in the stair core and watched the rail answer with a small, polite warmth. The window opened; the pumps did not argue. Somewhere a relay they could afford to lose had a small black mark in a ledger and a promise beside it: owed.

The stipend would buy batteries that didn’t squeal when they were scared. The statute would keep the window from being called a fault by someone who had never had to choose between perfect charts and sleeping babies.

“Three‑on, two‑off,” she counted under her breath, and the building counted with her.
