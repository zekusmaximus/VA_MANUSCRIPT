Dawn painted Luminara's eastern edge in shades of gold, but Amara's attention was fixed on the darkness in her data. The power fluctuations had evolved overnight, forming patterns that made her stomach twist. She stood at the sector boundary, tablet displaying three different analysis streams, each telling the same impossible story.
      "That can't be right," she muttered, running another diagnostic. The numbers didn't change. The city's neural grid wasn't just being accessed, it was being systematically mapped. Each anomaly she'd tracked formed part of a larger pattern, like someone taking a perfect digital impression of Luminara's nervous system.
      Her tablet chimed with an incoming data packet. Anonymous source, but the encryption was elegant, a living algorithm that evolved as she watched, adapting to her attempts to analyze it. She recognized the base structure from her own early work with Dr. Veltri, but this version was different. Wilder. More alive.
      "Interesting choice," a voice said behind her. "Using the old neural pathways to trace the new ones."
      Amara turned to find a woman emerging from the morning mist. Dark skin marked with faint lines of phosphorescent algae, not the fashionable patterns from the city center, but something more purposeful. Technical data flowing in living circuits.
      "Nia," the woman introduced herself. "But you already knew that from the Network messages."
      "I wasn't sure you were real," Amara admitted. "The data patterns you sent "
      "Are happening everywhere." Another figure appeared: tall, thin, with fingers that moved constantly over a hidden interface. "I'm Jin. Network security. And you're not the only one who's noticed."
      Jin's gesture painted the air with light, a holographic display of power grids. Not just Luminara's, but others. Cities across the globe, their neural networks pulsing with the same systematic disruptions.
      "Corporate optimization protocols," a familiar voice added. Ravi stepped into view, his usual control room precision replaced by something more urgent. "But look at the pattern beneath the pattern."
      He manipulated the display, and Amara's breath caught. Beneath the official power flows, barely visible, ran other networks. Unofficial connections, community systems, improvised solutions, a hidden web of human ingenuity that the corporate programs were slowly, methodically mapping.
      "Impossible," Amara whispered, but her hands were already moving through the data. "The security systems we designed "
      "Were brilliant," a new voice interrupted. A woman old enough to remember the world before Luminara, her weathered hands decorated with circuitry scars. "I'm Elena. I was there when they first raised this city. When we still thought technology alone could save us."
      "The security systems work exactly as designed," Ravi said. "That's the problem. They're so perfect, so controlled, that they've become predictable. Vulnerable to anyone who understands their patterns well enough."
      "Someone like Dr. Veltri," Nia added quietly.
      Amara's defense of her mentor died in her throat as Elena pulled up another dataset. Inspection records, resource analyses, efficiency studies, all bearing Veltri's signature. All focusing on the hidden networks, the unofficial systems, the community adaptations that corporate systems weren't supposed to see.
      "She said she was studying system optimization," Amara said, but the words felt hollow.
      "She is." Jin's fingers danced through the data. "But optimization doesn't always mean improvement. Sometimes it means standardization. Control. Replacement."
      The holographic displays merged, showing the full scope of what was happening. Corporate systems weren't just mapping the official grid, they were documenting every alternative, every adaptation, every solution communities had developed to survive.
      "Why show me this?" Amara asked, though part of her already knew.
      "Because it's not just about power distribution anymore," a new voice answered. Kevin emerged from the shadows, looking grimmer than he had at yesterday's council meeting. "It's about who controls the future. The corporate vision of perfect, predictable efficiency, or humanity's messy, brilliant capacity to adapt and grow."
      He gestured, and the displays shifted again. Now they showed something new: places where communities had modified Luminara's original systems. Improved them. Made them more resilient, more alive. Made them into something the corporate algorithms couldn't predict or control.
      "Someone in the Wastelands," Kevin said carefully, "has been improving your old reactor designs. Making them work in ways your corporate assessments said were impossible. Want to see?"
      Amara looked at her tablet, still displaying the elegant encryption from the anonymous message. At the living algorithms that had evolved beyond their original programming. At the future being slowly, systematically mapped and optimized out of existence.
      "Show me," she said.
