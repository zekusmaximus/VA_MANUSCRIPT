Tenebra Pediatric Cove: An elder tapped a cane against a vent grate—three‑on, two‑off—and a child tapped back with a smile like an oath. Valve heat trended down one tenth of a degree; the display didn’t cheer, but the nurse did.

Hawkline Annex Roof: A gardening crew clipped tassels of signal grass to teach the atmo how to carry memory with air. The buffer took morning heat into cloth and returned it to a stairwell that lied about being warm on charts and cold at skin.

Brightline Corridor: The concierge tied “all’s well” under the rail at window hour and made extra tea without logging why. Compressor load ticked down another point‑two; Kwan filed a note that said he had no comment and meant he did.

Arc‑9 Stair Core: Watchers posted in place of lost cameras, cloth tags along the handrails—three for water, two for heat, one for all’s well. A teen copied the night’s flows in charcoal while a runner checked the relay they could afford to lose if GHOST‑3 had to burn.
