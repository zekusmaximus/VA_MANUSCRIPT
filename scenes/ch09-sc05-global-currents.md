Tenebra Pediatric Cove: An elder tapped three‑on, two‑off; a child tapped back. Valve heat ticked down a tenth. The display didn’t cheer; the nurse did.

Hawkline Annex Roof: Signal grass carried memory with air. Morning heat moved into cloth and back to a stairwell that lied on charts and told the truth to skin.

Brightline Corridor: Concierge tied “all’s well” at window hour and made extra tea. Compressor load dipped 0.2; Kwan filed a note that said he had no comment and meant he did.

Arc‑9 Stair Core: Watchers replaced lost cameras; cloth tags along the rail—three for water, two for heat, one for all’s well. A teen copied the night’s flows in charcoal while a runner checked the relay they could afford to lose if GHOST‑3 had to burn.

Jin pinned the feeds and added the caption the city could live by: this is what the heartbeat is for.

Tenebra addendum: a grandmother moved her chair closer to the vent and started telling a story about storms that had learned not to knock. The child stopped counting and just breathed. The nurse wrote “story” in the ledger under human notes and underlined it twice, as if to apologize to no one for her professionalism.

Hawkline addendum: the gardening crew argued kindly about whether tassels should be cut to the elbow or the wrist. “Elbow holds heat longer,” someone said. “Wrist remembers faster,” someone else said. They tried both and the stairwell chose wrist. The crew shrugged and wrote: stairwell likes wrist. Fine.

Brightline addendum: a hotel guest asked what the knots meant and the concierge said, “They mean someone is listening,” and the guest tipped like gratitude was a currency again. Kwan’s no comment went out to the press. Inside, he stapled stipend forms to a corkboard and wrote in small letters: bring them to me when you’re ready.

Arc‑9 addendum: the teen with charcoal smudged their own face and then leaned into it, drawing a legend for the ledger so their little brother could read it later without asking. A runner tied a small knot at the bottom of the page for courage.

On a map Jin didn’t show anyone, he drew a line from each of these small beats to the window that was coming in Chapter Ten. It looked like thread. It looked like a net.
