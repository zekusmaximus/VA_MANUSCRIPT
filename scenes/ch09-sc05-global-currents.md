Tenebra Pediatric Cove: An elder tapped three‑on, two‑off against the wall beside a child's cot; the child tapped back with small fists, concentrating so hard her tongue stuck out. Valve heat ticked down a tenth. The display didn't cheer; the nurse did, quietly, with a hand on the elder's shoulder that said thank you and I see you and we're doing this together.

Hawkline Annex Roof: Signal grass carried memory with air, the tassels cut to wrist-length so they'd remember faster. Morning heat moved into cloth and back to a stairwell that lied on charts and told the truth to skin. The gardener who measured the grass each morning had calluses from rope and soil, and she sang a counting song her grandmother had taught her—three beats rising, two beats falling, old before the buildings were.

Brightline Corridor: Concierge tied "all's well" at window hour and made extra tea—real tea, the expensive kind he bought with his own money because the cheap stuff tasted like regret. Compressor load dipped 0.2; Kwan filed a note that said he had no comment and meant he did, meant he saw what was working and would defend it if the Board came asking.

Arc‑9 Stair Core: Watchers replaced lost cameras; cloth tags along the rail—three for water, two for heat, one for all’s well. A teen copied the night’s flows in charcoal while a runner checked the relay they could afford to lose if GHOST‑3 had to burn.

Jin pinned the feeds and added the caption the city could live by: this is what the heartbeat is for.

Tenebra addendum: a grandmother moved her chair closer to the vent and started telling a story about storms that had learned not to knock. The child stopped counting and just breathed. The nurse wrote “story” in the ledger under human notes and underlined it twice, as if to apologize to no one for her professionalism.

Hawkline addendum: the gardening crew argued kindly about whether tassels should be cut to the elbow or the wrist. “Elbow holds heat longer,” someone said. “Wrist remembers faster,” someone else said. They tried both and the stairwell chose wrist. The crew shrugged and wrote: stairwell likes wrist. Fine.

Brightline addendum: a hotel guest asked what the knots meant and the concierge said, “They mean someone is listening,” and the guest tipped like gratitude was a currency again. Kwan’s no comment went out to the press. Inside, he stapled stipend forms to a corkboard and wrote in small letters: bring them to me when you’re ready.

Arc‑9 addendum: the teen with charcoal smudged their own face and then leaned into it, drawing a legend for the ledger so their little brother could read it later without asking. The legend had small drawings beside each symbol—a water drop, a flame, a tiny face smiling. Teaching through pictures because the little brother was six and couldn't read full sentences yet but could recognize love when it was drawn for him. A runner tied a small knot at the bottom of the page for courage.

On a map Jin didn't show anyone, he drew a line from each of these small beats to the window that was coming in Chapter Ten. Tenebra to High Garden. Hawkline to the plateau. Brightline to the coastal settlements. Arc-9 to everywhere that had learned to count without clocks. It looked like thread. It looked like a net. It looked like the way trust spreads when you stop trying to control it—messy, organic, stronger than any system he could have designed on purpose.

He saved the map with a file name that wouldn't draw attention: MISC_NOTES_09. He would show it to Amara later, when there was time to acknowledge what they'd built without having to celebrate it yet.
