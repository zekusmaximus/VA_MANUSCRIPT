From: S‑SEC Field Ops — Stability Enforcement
Subject: Baseline Assurance — Optics Clause

The line near the bottom always said the quiet part: "forced baselines as needed to maintain optics."

Riya took the memo to a corridor no one photographed, where the paint was the color of old bandages and the overhead lights flickered in a way that maintenance had learned to ignore. Housekeeping had tied a single neat knot under the rail—tight, precise, the kind of work that came from hands that had practiced in private before they dared to show it in public.

"Window's three seconds," the concierge said when she noticed Riya staring. He was older, gray at the temples, with the kind of steady voice that came from defusing arguments before they became incidents. "We listen before we fix. Fewer complaints. You can hear it when it's wrong."

Riya could. The air in the corridor moved in small breaths—not the flat mechanical push she'd been trained to enforce, but something that paused, waited, resumed. She stood there long enough that the concierge went back to his clipboard, trusting her not to undo what was working.

She highlighted the clause on her tablet—the cursor leaving a surgical yellow trail across "forced baselines as needed to maintain optics"—and wrote herself a note she didn't send: Stabilize human systems, not optics. Find the breath.

The last time she had followed the letter instead of the breath, she had flattened a night market into a tableau the camera loved and the people did not. Perfect queues. Perfect silence. Perfect compliance with baseline thermal policy. The report had read "complaints: nil," because no one files a form when the queue looks orderly and feels like a held breath.

She had gone home and slept badly and woken with the sentence "we fixed it" souring in her mouth. The market had reopened the next day with half the usual vendors. The week after, three more stalls stayed empty. No one said it was her fault. No one had to. She had enforced the optics and broken the thing she was supposed to protect.

She had not written any of that down. Admitting failure in an official capacity meant metrics, reviews, corrective action plans that would follow her jacket for years. So she'd filed a clean report and carried the weight in private, in the space between her ribs where regret lives.

This time she wrote. Not to the Board—she wasn't foolish—but to herself, on paper that could live in a pocket and burn if necessary. If the room is already listening, do not shout over it. If the board asks for proof, bring a ledger and a person. She underlined "person" hard enough that the pen tore the paper slightly.

She pinged Zara on a private channel with no subject line. “Your five-beat note made it into our guidance,” she typed. “If clamps show at the plateau, we will be there.” She hovered over send, swallowed, sent.

At the far end of the corridor, a janitor practiced tying ALL'S WELL with the clumsy grace of someone who had only just learned the alphabet of string. His fingers fumbled the third loop twice before it held. The knot hung crooked but earnest, the way first attempts do.

"I don't know what we're allowed," he said when he saw her watching. His uniform was too big for him and his shoes had been repaired with tape. He looked like he expected to be told to stop.

"Allowed is shifting," Riya said, and surprised herself by not qualifying it with a warning, not adding the usual careful language about monitoring and review periods. "If anyone gives you trouble, say Officer Mandal told you to tie it."

He blinked. "Will you get in trouble for that?"

Probably. "It's cover," she said. "Use it." It wasn't policy. It was her putting her name on a practice the Board hadn't endorsed yet, and if things went wrong at High Garden her jacket would remember this conversation. She found she didn't care as much as she should have.

The janitor nodded slowly and turned back to his work, this time tying the knot with slightly more confidence. Riya watched him for another beat, then made herself walk away before the doubt could catch up.

Her tablet chimed with the stand-up for the next morning. High Garden route flagged. Beacons. Keep off Solace air. She pictured the clamp team's roster and the names she would have to argue with—two senior ops who thought variance was another word for chaos, and one shift lead who measured success in perfectly flat graphs.

She pictured the child who would sleep if they got it right. The grandmother who would stop counting her own breaths. The plateau settlement that had already tied five-beat reminders into their children's wrists.

"We'll make room," she said to the empty air, and meant it as both promise and threat. She saved the note she'd written to herself, backed it up twice, and put the paper in her jacket pocket where her badge used to rest before she learned that some authority had to be earned instead of issued.
