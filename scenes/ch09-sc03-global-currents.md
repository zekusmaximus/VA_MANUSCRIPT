From: S‑SEC Field Ops — Stability Enforcement
Subject: Baseline Assurance — Optics Clause

The line near the bottom always said the quiet part: “forced baselines as needed to maintain optics.”

Riya took the memo to a corridor no one photographed, where housekeeping had tied a single neat knot under the rail. “Window’s three seconds,” the concierge said. “We listen before we fix. Fewer complaints. You can hear it when it’s wrong.”

Riya could. She highlighted the clause and wrote herself a note she didn’t send: Stabilize human systems, not optics. Find the breath.

The last time she had followed the letter instead of the breath, she had flattened a night market into a tableau the camera loved and the people did not. The report had read “complaints: nil,” because no one files a form when the queue looks orderly and feels like a held breath. She had gone home and slept badly and woken with the sentence “we fixed it” souring in her mouth. She had not written any of that down.

This time she wrote. Not to the Board—she wasn’t foolish—but to herself, on paper that could live in a pocket. If the room is already listening, do not shout over it. If the board asks for proof, bring a ledger and a person.

She pinged Zara on a private channel with no subject line. “Your five-beat note made it into our guidance,” she typed. “If clamps show at the plateau, we will be there.” She hovered over send, swallowed, sent.

At the far end of the corridor, a janitor practiced tying ALL’S WELL with the clumsy grace of someone who had only just learned the alphabet of string. “I don’t know what we’re allowed,” he said when he saw her watching.

“Allowed is shifting,” Riya said, and surprised herself by not qualifying it with a warning. “If anyone gives you trouble, say Officer Mandal told you to tie it.” It wasn’t policy. It was cover. It would do for now.

Her tablet chimed with the stand-up for the next morning. High Garden route flagged. Beacons. Keep off Solace air. She pictured the clamp team’s roster and the names she would have to argue with. She pictured the child who would sleep if they got it right. “We’ll make room,” she said to the empty air, and meant it as both promise and threat.
