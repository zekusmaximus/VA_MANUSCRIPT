Subject: Baseline Assurance – Optics Clause Application

Language near the bottom always said the quiet part. “Forced baselines as needed to maintain optics.” The first time Riya Mandal read it she didn’t notice; the tenth time it felt like a hand on a vent.

In the break between runs she took her tablet to a corridor no one photographed, where housekeeping had tied a single neat knot under the rail. The air here held steady the way good hands hold a child—firm without flattening.

“Window’s three seconds,” the concierge said when Riya asked what they were doing. “We listen before we fix. We get fewer complaints.” She looked at Riya’s badge without apology. “You can hear it when it’s wrong.”

Riya could. She always had. The memo’s clause and the room’s breath met in her chest like two truths that refused to be made enemies. She highlighted the line in the order set and wrote herself a note she didn’t send: Stabilize human systems, not optics. Find the breath.
