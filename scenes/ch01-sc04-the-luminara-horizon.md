The elevator to Dr. Veltri's lab rode smoother than it used to, Amara noticed. The old hydraulic system had been replaced with something quieter, more efficient. More corporate. Even the air felt different, no longer the humid warmth of the experimental algae tanks, but something cooler, more controlled.
      The doors opened onto a space she barely recognized. Gone were the crowded workbenches where she and Veltri had spent countless nights perfecting Luminara's first neural grid. In their place stood sleek holographic terminals bearing the Solace Industries logo. The living walls remained, but their wild tangles of experimental species had been replaced by perfectly uniform rows of optimization-engineered plants.
      "I thought I might see you tonight." Dr. Elara Veltri stood at the window wall, her silver hair gleaming in the festival lights that painted the sky beyond. She didn't turn around. "The grid's behavior has your fingerprints all over it."
      "My fingerprints?" Amara moved to stand beside her former mentor. "The irregularities in Sector 7 "
      "Are necessary adjustments." Veltri's reflection smiled in the glass. "The system's evolving, Amara. Just like we always wanted."
      But this wasn't evolution. Amara had seen the truth in Sector 7's shadows, in the pulse of unauthorized flowers. "The grid's being rewritten," she said. "Corporate protocols overriding the neural networks we designed. The system isn't evolving, it's being replaced."
      Now Veltri did turn, her eyes sharp despite her gentle expression. "You always did see patterns others missed. It's why you were my best student." She walked to one of the new terminals, calling up a global display. "But you're not seeing the whole picture. Look."
      The hologram showed Earth's power distribution networks, the bright clusters of green cities like Luminara, the vast dark spaces between them. "Our methods work here, in our perfect floating city," Veltri continued. "But what about them?" She gestured to the dark zones. "Don't they deserve what we have?"
      "Of course they do," Amara said. "But Solace Industries isn't interested in equality. The power they're siphoning through those old substations, the way they're mapping the unofficial networks "
      "Is necessary for scaling our technology." Veltri's voice hardened slightly. "Solace has resources we never dreamed of. Global reach. The ability to implement our innovations everywhere, not just in one experimental city."
      "At what cost?" Amara moved to the terminal, pulling up the Sector 7 data. "Look at these patterns. They're not studying the network, they're trying to control it. To replace organic adaptation with corporate protocols."
      "Control isn't always the enemy." Veltri waved her hand, replacing the data with a new image, a simulation of a world covered in Luminara-like cities. "Sometimes it's necessary for growth. For true progress."
      "Progress?" Amara thought of the glowing flowers in Sector 7, of Kevin's words about community and connection. "What about the people who depend on those unofficial networks? The innovations happening in the Wastelands, the communities finding their own solutions?"
      "Inefficient solutions." Veltri's tone was gentle, almost maternal. "Beautiful in their way, yes, but ultimately limited. With Solace's help, we can implement standardized systems globally. Clean power for everyone, not just the lucky few."
      "Standardized." The word felt wrong in Amara's mouth. "You taught me that living systems need diversity to thrive. That the best solutions emerge from adaptation, not control."
      "I taught you to think bigger." Veltri touched the simulation, making it spin faster. "And now I'm thinking bigger than ever. Luminara was just the prototype, Amara. With Solace's resources, we can transform the whole world."
      A notification flashed across the display, power demands from the festival reaching critical levels. Veltri dismissed it with a casual gesture. "Change is coming, whether we guide it or not. I choose to guide it."
      "And if that guidance means destroying what makes Luminara unique? The neural networks, the community connections, the organic growth?"
      "Sometimes we have to sacrifice beauty for necessity." Veltri's eyes were distant, seeing that imagined future. "I hoped you'd understand. You used to share my vision."
      "I still share the vision," Amara said quietly. "But not the methods."
      Veltri studied her for a long moment. "The council votes next week on Solace's proposal for full integration of city systems. I trust you'll remember where your loyalties lie."
      "I remember everything you taught me," Amara replied. "Including the difference between growth and control."
      She turned to leave, but Veltri's voice stopped her at the door. "The world is watching Luminara, Amara. We can't afford to let sentiment obstruct progress."
      Amara looked back at her mentor, silhouetted against the city lights. For a moment, she saw both versions of Veltri, the passionate scientist who had taught her to love living systems, and the corporate visionary willing to sacrifice those same systems for a greater goal.
      "Progress without wisdom," Amara said softly, "is just another form of destruction."
      The elevator doors closed on Veltri's reply. As Amara descended, her tablet lit up with another alert from Sector 7. The power fluctuations were reaching a critical point. The festival's demands were straining the grid. And somewhere in the darkness below, unauthorized flowers still pulsed their warning.
      She had one more stop to make before the night was over. One more pattern to understand before she could decide what to do next.
      The mentor she had trusted was now the threat she had to face. And the city's heart hung in the balance.
