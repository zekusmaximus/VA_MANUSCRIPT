The elevator to Dr. Veltri's lab glided without a shiver. Once it hummed and sighed like the building was breathing with you; now it kept its own careful silence. Even the air had been disciplined—no briny warmth from algae tanks, just a scrubbed, temperature‑flat cool.
      The doors opened onto a space she had to map against memory. Workbenches—gone. The jury‑rigged rigs she and Veltri had coaxed through long nights—replaced by Solace‑branded holography. The living walls were still here, but their wild braids had been trained into identical rows. Leaves spaced like gridlines. The plants inhaled and exhaled together on a clock she could almost hear.
      "I thought I might see you tonight." Dr. Elara Veltri stood at the window wall, silver hair catching festival color. She didn't turn. "The grid's behavior has your fingerprints all over it."
      "My fingerprints?" Amara moved to stand beside her former mentor. "The irregularities in Sector 7 "
      "Are necessary adjustments." Veltri's reflection smiled without quite reaching her eyes. "The system is evolving, Amara. Just like we always wanted."
      Amara had seen Sector 7's truth in the pulse of unauthorized flowers. "The grid is being rewritten," she said. "Corporate protocols are teaching a living network to hold still. That's not evolution. That's replacement."
      Veltri turned, the gentleness intact, the focus sharpened. "You always saw patterns others missed. It's why you were my best student." She crossed to a terminal; a global display blossomed. "But you aren't seeing the whole picture. Look."
      The hologram traced Earth's power distribution: islands of bright green cities like Luminara adrift in vast dark. "Our methods work here," Veltri said. "But what about them?" She gestured at the unlit expanse. "Don't they deserve what we have?"
      "Of course," Amara said. "But Solace isn't practicing equity. The siphons at the old substations, the quiet mapping of unofficial links—"
      "—are necessary to scale," Veltri finished, voice firming. "Solace has reach we never dreamed of. Implementation at world scale, not a single prototype city."
      "At what cost?" Amara stepped in, overlaying Sector 7. "This isn't study; it's pacing. Probe, nudge, tighten. Replacing adaptation with protocol."
      "Control isn't always the enemy." Veltri swept the data aside and spun up a simulation: a world tessellated with Luminara‑like cities. "Sometimes control is scaffolding—for growth. For progress." 
      "Progress?" Amara thought of Sector 7's flowers, of Kevin's block‑to‑block microgrids. "What about people who live in those unofficial networks? The Wastelands' innovations? Communities solving for their own contexts?"
      "Fragile solutions," Veltri said, almost fond. "Beautiful, yes—but bounded. With Solace, we can standardize. Clean power, everywhere. Not just the lucky few."
      "Standardized." The word sat wrong on Amara's tongue. "You taught me living systems thrive on diversity. The best solutions emerge from adaptation, not imposition."
      "I taught you to think bigger." Veltri accelerated the globe until it blurred. "Luminara was a prototype. With Solace, we can change the whole world."
      A notification strobed at the edge of the sim: festival demand near critical. Veltri dismissed it without looking. "Change is coming, guided or not. I prefer guided."
      "And if that guidance means flattening what makes Luminara alive? The neural networks. The community weave. The way growth learns."
      "Sometimes we choose necessity over messy beauty," Veltri said, eyes on the bright simulation. "I hoped you'd understand. You used to."
      "I share the vision," Amara said. "Not the method."
      Veltri studied her. "The council votes next week on full Solace integration. I trust you'll remember where your loyalties lie."
      "I remember what you taught me," Amara said. "Including the difference between growth and control."
      She turned to go. Veltri's voice followed. "The world is watching Luminara. Sentiment can't obstruct progress."
      Amara looked back: the mentor who taught her to listen to living systems and the visionary who would pace them to a metronome. 
      "Progress without wisdom," she said, "is another form of destruction."
      The elevator doors closed on Veltri's reply. As Amara descended, her tablet lit: another Sector 7 alert. Festival load pressing the limits. Below, the unauthorized flowers would be pulsing—not just a warning, but an invitation to listen.
      One more stop before dawn. One more pattern to hear clearly before choosing how to act.
      The mentor she had trusted now stood on the other side of the choice. The city's heartbeat waited.
