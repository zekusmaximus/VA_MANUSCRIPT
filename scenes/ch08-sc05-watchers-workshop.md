Elena split the room into crews of four. "One timekeeper, two buffers, one scribe. Switch roles every fifteen minutes. If anyone's hurt, they sit and lead. No heroics."

The first drill was listening. Not to a graph, but to the stairwell itself. They stood on the landing between floors where heat pooled by habit and moved like gossip. The concierge closed her eyes and put two fingers on the metal, counting under her breath. Three on, two off. The janitor watched the condensation at the grate and matched his breath to it without being told.

"Ledger, please," Elena said, and the kid with the charcoal wrote like a court recorder.

Listening Window (Practice)
- Timekeeper: 3s on / 2s off cadence heard at rail
- Ambient temp: 19 C (cool morning)
- Drift: within +/- 0.3 s
- Complaint volume: 0 during window (hall quiet)
- Human note: tea station placed on cooler side reduces crowding

They laid out the shawls next. Old conductive weave patched more than once, still good at learning heat. Saltwater in a bucket. Cotton towels washed so many times they had the softness of truth. Elena showed the switch: skin to shawl, shawl to rail, rail to root when cold tried to steal the breath.

"Buffer draw half a degree to a degree per ten meters of rail," she said, tapping the margin where numbers lived. "If you pull more, you will make the rails sting and the room will call you a fool. If you pull less, you'll make no difference and call it patience."

Pilo ran the closet-clamp drill with a tourist's enthusiasm and a technician's patience. He wheeled a cart to a maintenance door and clicked a portable unit on. The graph leapt toward 'perfect' and the stairwell went wrong.

"Everyone feels that?" Elena said. No one needed the display to tell them. The landing's breath fell to a flat line that felt like a held note without a song.

The janitor reached into the closet like someone rescuing a stubborn cat and flicked the unit off with two fingers. Laughter. Then he set the sticker they had printed earlier across the front: CLOSET CLAMP. A child drew a skull next to it with great dignity.

Kwan arrived halfway through with a folder and a pen that looked heavy. He stayed at the back. When Elena finished the stipend section, he stepped forward without performance.

"Stipends are lines in a budget, not favors," he said, placing the forms on a table instead of holding them like a bribe. "Watchers are an operational role. We pay vendors for filters and we will pay you for listening."

They practiced the paperwork like they practiced cadence. Name, shift, location, knot code literacy (Y/N), hours under window. The concierge wrote slowly as if writing on behalf of every concierge who had ever had to ask if her work counted.

"What if it goes wrong?" someone asked from the doorway. Housekeeping, voice steady.

"Then we teach the memory," Elena said. "We widen the window within the guardrails. We move heat to cloth and breath to roots. We do not chase smooth lines. We log cost if cost comes. And we call for help early."

She turned to the whiteboard and sketched a box around the lines everyone kept repeating.

Guardrails (v0.9)
- Leader sits if wounded
- Rotation up to 15 minutes, then swap
- Ghost ceilings: <= 60 seconds per hour
- Buffer draw: 0.5–1.0 C per 10 m of rail
- Drift tolerance: +/- 0.3 s (5-beat at altitude)
- If a noncritical node must burn to save breath, log COST: ONE NODE

"Write the part about mercy," the elder said from a seat near the door. "You wrote the numbers. Write the mercy."

Elena wrote: 'Windows are not faults.' And below it: 'Mercy is a window you open on purpose.' The room got quieter in a way that meant it was listening.

They ended with a live run on the corridor. No drama. Just practice. Timekeeper called three on, two off; buffers moved heat like a braid; the scribe recorded without embellishment.

Corridor Window (Live)
- Compressor load: -0.2% during window
- Complaints: -1 (resolved by tea and a blanket)
- Drift: within +/- 0.3 s
- Knot code sent: ALL'S WELL at close, tied by housekeeping

Pilo peeled the CLOSET CLAMP sticker off and put it back on straighter. "For the record," he said, and the room laughed the clean laugh of people who had done a good hour's work.

On the way out, a kid lifted the ledger as if it were a storybook and asked if she could copy the knots onto her own cloth tags at home. Elena said yes. The child's face did a quiet kind of shining. The poster on the wall kept its crooked angle like a little rebellion and a reminder.

Concierge hands looked wrong on a calibration form until you watched what they did with it.

“No specialists,” Elena said, walking the room through cadence and guardrails. “Leader sits if wounded. Stipend line lives here.” She tapped the budget column like a metronome. The janitor’s pencil hovered, then moved with certainty.

Pilo frowned at the closet clamp diagram and then laughed when the group labeled it exactly that. A child traced knot code onto cloth tags with charcoal and careful pride.

“Windows are not faults,” the Chair’s statute read from the poster someone had taped crooked on purpose. In practice, it meant fewer fights with thermostats and more people who knew how to listen to rails.
