The call hit as a pressure change across Amara’s interface—garden air gone thin. Nia’s band followed a beat later, tight but steady. "Deep Court hybrid is drifting. Corporate probes targeting bio‑interfaces. I’m onsite."
      "You shouldn’t be on your feet," Elena said over the mesh, worry sharpening age into iron.
      "I’m not," Nia said, and Amara pictured the stubborn grace of her, seated with one leg elevated and everything else moving. "I’m in the heart bed. We don’t have time for perfect."

Amara arrived to a garden breathing wrong. Vines that should have exhaled cool in the shade were holding their breath. The air tasted of antiseptic instead of loam. Underfoot, root nets hummed a frequency she associated with hospitals—clean, controlled, afraid.
      Nia sat with her back to a column grown from woven trunks, a brace around her injured leg, shawl thrown over shoulders like a general’s banner. Three apprentices clustered nearby—Maya, all bright eyes and quick hands; Seve, who read roots like sheet music; and Lio, whose palms were scratched from climbing places gardens said "no" to and then "all right, then."
      "They’re pushing a lock through the bio‑layer," Nia said without preamble, fingers ghosting over a console grown from bark. "Telling the algae to classify change as infection."
      "It’ll stop learning to protect itself," Amara said. She felt the old fear move in her like a tide—the ruin control could cause when it wore the language of care.
      "Exactly. Calibration’s lagging from the hit." Nia tapped the brace. "I can’t anchor the learning clock through my interface without cascading pain through the mesh. So we use a different clock."
      Maya’s chin lifted. "Ours?"
      Nia’s mouth twitched. "Yours."

She took a breath that the garden heard. "We’re going hands‑forward," Nia told her crew. "Skin conductivity, shawls, and root contact. No heroics. You’re buffers, not martyrs. Seve—strip the conductive fringe from three shawls. Lio—wash your hands and forearms with saltwater and dry with the old cotton. No synthetic residue. Maya—bring me the heart‑bed ledger. We’ll give the roots a pulse that matches yours."
      Amara moved to the far console, fingers light. "Jin, I need a ghosted read—low‑risk. Keep Solace sensors blinded to anything that looks like a ‘fault’ while we teach this system to listen."
      "Already carving a narrow path," Jin said. "I can hide a metronome in the housekeeping feed, but only for a minute at a time."
      "A minute is a luxury," Nia murmured, and the apprentices smiled despite fear.

Corporate probes sang down the line again. Amara watched their signature—so elegant, so wrong—slide across the algae’s surfaces, flagging difference as disease. The garden flinched from itself.
      "Roots want to learn," Nia told them. "They just can’t when someone keeps telling them the lesson is a threat. Maya—what’s your resting pulse?"
      Maya placed a finger against her neck, then the ledger. "Eighty‑two."
      "Good. We’ll call that one." Nia glanced at Seve. "You’re a cool seventy when you’re scared. Don’t deny it. Lio?"
      Lio grinned like a daredevil at a cathedral. "Ninety‑one."
      "We’ll stagger you as a choir," Nia said. "Maya, then Seve, then Lio. Three beats on, two off. Root contact here, here, and here." She pointed to shallow basins where the heart‑bed’s thickest roots surfaced like whales. "Amara—shift the variance buffer to shawls when they’re on. Back to roots when they’re off. We’ll teach the bio‑layer the pattern of human breath and let it remember."
      Amara nodded. "I can catch half a degree into cloth and return it downstream to the misshapen shelves near the east wall. They’ve been ‘correcting’ drafts for hours."
      "Let them rest," Nia said, and her voice made the command sound like love.

They scrubbed, dried, and took their stations. Nia’s hand hovered above the ledger as if blessing a rite. "On my count," she said, and counted in a cadence that made something in Amara’s chest relax despite the alarms.
      Maya pressed both palms into the damp soil. The shawl on her shoulders warmed; along the rail, a cloth tag—three knots for water—shivered without moving. The algae read skin and thread and deferred correction. Seve replaced Maya on the second beat, then Lio on the third. After two beats of rest, Maya returned.
      The garden’s panic line softened almost visibly.
      "Buffer catch at point‑three degrees," Amara reported. "Compressor load down point‑one. AQ stable."
      "Still seeing probes," Jin warned. "They’re watching for error and writing poetry about ‘stability.’"
      "Let them read a poem about care," Nia said. Her hands trembled once, then stilled.

The probes adapted, as they did, trying to find the gaps. One slid under Maya’s second beat and jabbed with an antiseptic spike that made her suck air between her teeth.
      "Out," Nia said, and Maya lifted. Nia touched the soil herself. Her interface flickered pain so bright Amara tasted it; Nia did not move. "Hello," she said to the algae. "This is not infection. This is life."
      The spike hesitated then changed signature, confused by a pulse that did not match expected symptoms. Amara shifted the buffer and caught the sliver into cloth.
      "Rotation holds," Seve said, voice low with awe. "They’re learning us."
      "As it should be," Nia said. "As they should have been allowed to do from the beginning."

On the mezzanine above, watchers came: two elders, a teen with charcoal‑stained fingers, a janitor with forearms like planks. One of the elders tucked a cloth tag under the rail and tied a knot with hands that had tied others in storms and births and funerals. One for all’s well. The teen began copying the breathing schedule into a makeshift ledger as if writing down how to sing.
      "Keep that record," Nia said without looking up. "If I go down, you lead."
      "You’re not going down," Amara said.
      "We plan like I might," Nia said, and Amara shut her mouth. That, too, was care.

"They’re escalating," Jin said. "Legacy admin key in the mix. Same signature we saw at Brightline before the closet."
      "Which node will burn if we hold?" Nia asked.
      Amara scanned the mesh. "Ghost‑six. It’s been complaining."
      "Noncritical?"
      "It will hurt," Amara said. "But it won’t kill our work."
      Nia nodded once. "Then we choose the hurt we can repair. On my mark—burn Ghost‑six for sixty seconds."
      Kevin’s voice arrived at last, breathless with having run across roofs. "I’m at the east stair. Do you need hands?"
      "Send watchers to the south rail with tags," Nia said. "If we lose eyes, we keep reading. And bring salt."

The next probe came like a hand pretending to comfort and checking for fever. Nia counted. Amara moved the buffer. Jin ghosted the metronome into a housekeeping feed that sounded like a vacuum in a cathedral. On Nia’s mark, Ghost‑six flared and went to black.
      The garden shook—once—like an animal shedding something it never asked to wear. Then it stilled into a rhythm that belonged to the room, not to a chart.
      "Load down point‑four," Amara said, relief making her voice too bright. She steadied it. "AQ stable. Root uptake normal."
      "Probes pulling back," Jin said. "Either they think they won or they’re fuming. Either way, the line’s quiet."
      "Watchers?" Nia asked.
      The janitor tied a knot so clean Amara wanted to frame it. "All’s well," he said, and smiled as if he’d put a child to bed.

They held the rotation for ten minutes more, then five, then one, until Nia trusted the bio‑layer to keep the clock without their hands. She rolled her shoulders as if taking off a pack. Pain lines bracketed her mouth; she did not hide them.
      "You’re going to tell me not to do that again," she said to Amara without heat.
      "I’m going to tell you I’m glad you did it now," Amara said. "And that next time we’ll have a human‑clock protocol so you don’t have to decide it while you’re hurting."
      Nia nodded. "Write it."
      Amara lifted a slate grown from bark. "Protocol: Hands‑Forward Buffering for Bio‑Layer Re‑education. Inputs: three human pulses staggered three‑on, two‑off. Conductive shawls; skin contact at root surfacing; variance buffer toggling to cloth during ‘on.’ Guardrails: salt scrub; no synthetic residue; maximum rotation time fifteen minutes; one noncritical node allowed to burn if required; watchers’ knot code active; concierge and janitor included as trained observers; ghost path limited to one minute bursts to avoid pattern learning."
      "Add: The person leading sits if wounded," Elena said dryly over the mesh.
      Nia’s laugh came out like a bark that softened into something true. "Add: The person leading remembers she is part of the garden, not above it."
      "Done," Amara said, and wrote it.

They debriefed against a trunk that smelled like memory. Maya’s hands shook as the adrenaline left. Seve stared at his palms as if they had told him a secret he would spend a life learning. Lio had the stunned joy of a kid who had jumped a gap and landed.
      "You did that," Nia told them, eyes on each in turn. "Not me alone. The system learned from you because you were careful and you listened. You will teach others."
      Maya blinked back tears. "Will it remember?"
      "Yes," Nia said. "Because we’ll let it. And we will not allow any line to call listening an error again."

Amara watched the apprentices leave with their new ledger and their old shawls. She stood beside Nia in the quiet after work and felt gratitude the way she felt a well‑tuned system—everywhere and in the bones.
      "You led," she said.
      "I held," Nia corrected, but the correction didn’t argue. It clarified. "And I’ll hold again, but not alone. The method lives now."
      "Playbook entry," Jin said, already distributing the protocol to sites marked FRAGILE in the Network. "Tagged: NIA‑HANDS‑FORWARD v1.0."
      Kevin arrived with salt and laughter, both of which the room needed. He placed the salt where the apprentices had stood as if feeding the memory of their work.
      "Council will ask for a report," Elena said. "They’ll want numbers and they’ll want someone to blame."
      "They’ll get a ledger and a story," Nia said. "And a room full of people who know what breathing feels like when it’s allowed."

In Amara’s interface, the garden’s signal settled into patterns too alive to map and too stable to fear. She watched the roots absorb a lesson written in human hands and return it as cool breath to a corner that had been hot all week.
      "We’ll leave the tag," Kevin said, tucking one knot under the rail. "All’s well—for this breath."
      "And the next one," Nia said, closing her eyes for a moment that was work and rest at once. "We’ll catch that too."
