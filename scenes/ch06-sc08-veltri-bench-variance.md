She took the speech out of it by writing like a technician.

Variance amplifier, advisory only. No keys. Heartbeat‑respecting. Bench rig: two meters of rail, one shawl, saltwater, three tags. Result: window widened by half a second without destabilizing the buffer draw. Side effect: people breathe easier when the board doesn’t scream at them for listening.

She didn’t write that last line. She tied a knot under the bench instead, a habit her hands had learned while her mouth caught up.
