The first packet hit Ravi’s console as light drawn through crystal—New Singapore’s “light‑dreams” encoding when a system inhales.
      “They marked pauses,” Elena said. Amara overlaid the S7 nursery breath she’d just sent. The interference wrote itself: three beats of listening, two of release.
      “Heartbeat,” Ravi said. Jin packaged the timing to ops: HEARTBEAT: LAND SEED ON EXHALE. Tagged for the seed‑run team and corridor crews who would be counting without clocks.
      Maya grinned. “A metronome made of light.”
      “And we’ll use it to teach a metronome to breathe,” Amara said, saving a single line above the timing: windows are not faults.

The second packet arrived with human voices braided into the photonic stream: a New Singapore engineer counting out loud for a child’s ward while a technician tapped the side of a coolant pipe so the mic would hear what skin already knew. Three on, two off. “We started doing this,” the engineer said, “because flat lines made people panic.” A laugh you could build a bridge on. “Turns out the machines panicked too.”

Jin split the feed across two panes—light-dream timing on the left, Helios exhale telemetry on the right. The pauses kissed each other at predictable intervals. “There,” he said. “That’s the window. Miss it and we pay in noise.”

“Risk if we’re late?” Ravi asked without looking away.

“We land on clamp pressure,” Jin said. “We teach the worst lesson at the worst time.”

Amara pinched the overlay tighter and sent a short note back down the line: confirmation, gratitude, a request for one more sequence at a slightly colder ambient. She did not explain optics, or Solace, or how much depended on getting this right. She just wrote: teach us one more time and we will carry it forward.

New Singapore obliged with a slow-breath variant, four on, three off, and a spoken aside: “We lengthen when the night air turns the rails to bone. Don’t force it. Listen first.”

“Altitude is five,” Maya said, eyes already at a window that hadn’t been opened yet. “Kaito wrote that into the wind.”

“Then Chapter Ten starts with weather,” Kevin said from a doorway, not trying to hide the bags under his eyes. “We’ll ride the beacons to the bowl and carry this timing like contraband.”

Ravi saved a strip of the feed with a human voice saying the quiet truth no directive ever writes: “If it helps, it’s allowed.” He pasted it under the ops timing and circled it in blue. “For morale,” he said, but Amara saw that he meant for faith.

The channel ended with a child in the background asking if the light was singing to them. “Yes,” someone said off mic. “It sings when you let it.”

Ravi pushed the new profile to the seed-run kit, to the corridor crews, to anyone who would ever have to count without a clock. The note at the top remained the same, now signed by more than one city: windows are not faults.
