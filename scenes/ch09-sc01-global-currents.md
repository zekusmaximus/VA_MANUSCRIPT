The first packet hit Ravi’s console as light drawn through crystal—New Singapore’s “light‑dreams” compressed into patterns that corporate augments labeled unclassifiable and Maya called “obvious once you listen.”
      “They’re solving time with light,” Jin said, leaning in. “Not just encoding data—measuring when a system inhales.”
      Elena traced the stream with her finger as if it were cloth. “They marked pauses,” she said. “Deliberately. Not noise.”
      Amara overlaid the reactor’s nursery breath she’d just sent up‑line from S7. The interference wrote itself: three beats of listening, two of release.
      “Heartbeat,” Ravi said. “Their light‑dream pause lands in the same cut as Helios’ dampener exhale.”
      Jin packaged a timing note straight into ops: HEARTBEAT: LAND SEED ON EXHALE. He tagged it for the seed‑run team and the corridor crews who would be counting without clocks. “Everyone moves the same rhythm,” he said. “Different instruments; one breath.”
      Maya grinned, hearing music where the others heard math. “They sent us a metronome made of light.”
      “And we’ll use it to teach a metronome to breathe,” Amara said, saving a human‑readable line above the timing: windows are not faults.
