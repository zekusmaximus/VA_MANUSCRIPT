The first packet hit Ravi's console as light drawn through crystal—New Singapore's "light‑dreams" encoding when a system inhales. The interface rendered it as ripples, like heat shimmer off equatorial concrete at noon. Ravi touched the waveform and felt his chest match the rhythm before his brain caught up.

"They marked pauses," Elena said, leaning in. Her tea had gone cold an hour ago. Amara overlaid the S7 nursery breath she'd just sent, fingers steady despite the fact that half the world was watching through this window. The interference wrote itself: three beats of listening, two of release. Not random. Not mechanical. Human.

"Heartbeat," Ravi said, and his voice did something it hadn't done in weeks—it steadied. Jin packaged the timing to ops: HEARTBEAT: LAND SEED ON EXHALE. Tagged for the seed‑run team and corridor crews who would be counting without clocks. The capslock felt like shouting but also like prayer.

Maya grinned. "A metronome made of light."

"And we'll use it to teach a metronome to breathe," Amara said, saving a single line above the timing: windows are not faults. She had written that sentence seventeen times in seventeen different contexts. It never stopped mattering.

The second packet arrived with human voices braided into the photonic stream: a New Singapore engineer counting out loud for a child's ward while a technician tapped the side of a coolant pipe so the mic would hear what skin already knew. Three on, two off. The counting had an accent that carried monsoon weather in its vowels, and the pipe-tap rang with the specific pitch of aluminum cooled by ocean air.

"We started doing this," the engineer said, "because flat lines made people panic." A laugh you could build a bridge on. "Turns out the machines panicked too."

Maya replayed that part twice, not for data but because the laugh made her homesick for a place she'd never been. "They're teaching us how to be kind to metal," she said.

"They're teaching us how to listen," Amara corrected gently.

Jin split the feed across two panes—light-dream timing on the left, Helios exhale telemetry on the right. The pauses kissed each other at predictable intervals. "There," he said, circling the convergence points with a fingertip that left smudges on a screen no one had time to clean. "That's the window. Miss it and we pay in noise."

“Risk if we’re late?” Ravi asked without looking away.

“We land on clamp pressure,” Jin said. “We teach the worst lesson at the worst time.”

Amara pinched the overlay tighter and sent a short note back down the line: confirmation, gratitude, a request for one more sequence at a slightly colder ambient. She did not explain optics, or Solace, or how much depended on getting this right. She just wrote: teach us one more time and we will carry it forward.

The reply took fourteen seconds. Fourteen seconds in which Elena chewed her thumbnail and Ravi held his breath like he was underwater. When the packet arrived, it carried the specific humidity of a server room cooled by equatorial night, the smell of ozone and patience.

New Singapore obliged with a slow-breath variant, four on, three off, and a spoken aside: "We lengthen when the night air turns the rails to bone. Don't force it. Listen first." The technician's voice had shifted—older, maybe, or just tired in the way that comes from caring about precision when lives depend on metal staying cool.

“Altitude is five,” Maya said, eyes already at a window that hadn’t been opened yet. “Kaito wrote that into the wind.”

“Then Chapter Ten starts with weather,” Kevin said from a doorway, not trying to hide the bags under his eyes. “We’ll ride the beacons to the bowl and carry this timing like contraband.”

Ravi saved a strip of the feed with a human voice saying the quiet truth no directive ever writes: "If it helps, it's allowed." He pasted it under the ops timing and circled it in blue. "For morale," he said, but Amara saw that he meant for faith. His hand shook slightly as he dragged the cursor. She pretended not to notice.

The channel ended with a child in the background asking if the light was singing to them. "Yes," someone said off mic, and then closer, as if they'd picked up the child to show them the screen: "It sings when you let it." The child hummed back—three notes rising, two falling. Unintentional perfect cadence.

Elena's eyes went wet. She turned toward the window where real light was just starting to thin the dark over the eastern ridges. "We're talking to strangers across an ocean using breath and metal," she said. "And it's working."

"It's working," Amara agreed, though she knew the hardest part was still coming.

Ravi pushed the new profile to the seed-run kit, to the corridor crews, to anyone who would ever have to count without a clock. The note at the top remained the same, now signed by more than one city: windows are not faults. He added New Singapore's timestamp and the child's humming frequency as a footnote no one had asked for. "For reference," he said, but they all knew he meant for remember.
