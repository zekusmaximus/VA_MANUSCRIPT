The old lab had smelled of damp earth and warm plastic, nights so long the algae learned their names.

Veltri, younger, hair pinned up with a pencil, leaned over a tray where roots traced mathematics Nia could almost hear. “You don’t force growth,” she said, not lecturing, remembering. “You trellis it. Give it something to climb so it won’t drown in its own abundance.”

They’d built a fork‑and‑coil clamp at two in the morning and laughed when the prototype finally sang. The bio‑layer took a lesson it hadn’t been taught because the room had been allowed to listen to itself before anyone corrected it.

“There,” Veltri said, soft pride more dangerous than any order. “That’s the sound of a system learning.”

Years later, the same woman would present the same curve with the same grace and call the gray around it acceptable. Nia kept both truths in her teeth like a bit. You could love a teacher and refuse the harm she learned to name as necessity.

On a yellowed index card—one of Elena’s that smelled faintly of mica and time—Nia wrote the rule Veltri had given her then, before the vocabulary wandered: Trellis, not control. 

When the heart‑bed needed a human clock, when hands‑forward would codify itself into a playbook, Nia would take the card out of a book where she kept old plant tags and slip it into a new ledger. Let the record show: the people who taught us to listen were right before the world taught them to forget.
