Helios always looked like certainty from the plaza. Up close it breathed like anything alive that had been taught not to show it.

“Clocks,” Jin said in Amara’s ear, voice a metronome with a smile he’d never admit to. “HEARTBEAT: LAND SEED ON EXHALE. Window in eight.”

“Copy,” Ravi said from the ops rail, where his hands hovered above a node he’d already promised to lose. “Baselines primed. If I have to cut, I cut.”

Kevin checked the woven sleeve at Amara’s chest. Serra’s work made the seed look like something you’d be careful with even if you didn’t know what it was. “We’re ghosts until we’re not.”

“We’re people until we’re proof,” Amara said, and shouldn’t have smiled, and did.

They moved inside the Spiral in the way you only can if you’ve built a thing and then walked away from it angry. Grids and vents and access petals lived in her hands like a city you can navigate when the lights are out.

“Five,” Jin said. “Four. Three—listen.”

Helios inhaled the way a dampener does when it’s about to correct. Amara felt it through the rail, through the sleeve, through the part of her that had tuned a nursery breath to a machine because that was what the job was then. This was the part of the job now: remembering that listening is the door.

“Two. One. Exhale.”

Amara set the seed into the loop the way you settle a sleeping child—no flourish, just weight and warmth in the right place. The capture’s three‑on, two‑off cadence met Helios’ pause and, for a moment, there was no such thing as force.

“Landing clean,” Ravi said. “No fight. Copying.”

“Hold it,” Jin breathed. “Don’t ask it to sing yet. Just hum.”

INTERCUT — Tenebra Pediatric Cove: The elder tapped three‑on, two‑off against the vent grate. Valve heat trended down another tenth. The nurse didn’t look up; she didn’t have to. “All right, little fish,” she said to the room. “All right.”

INTERCUT — Brightline Corridor: The concierge tied one knot as the window opened and set a cup of tea on the housekeeping cart. Compressor load dipped point‑two. Kwan watched from a tablet he pretended not to have brought to the floor.

INTERCUT — Hawkline Annex Roof: Signal grass shook like the processors were laughing. The buffer took the noon glare and gave it back to a stairwell that had earned it.

INTERCUT — Arc‑9 Stair Core: A watcher counted under her breath and didn’t know why she was crying. “GHOST‑3 ready,” the runner said. “Say when.”

“Seed is home,” Amara said, only then realizing she’d been bracing against bone. “It remembers.”

On the plaza below, the festival screens showed a spectacle that didn’t matter. Upstairs, Helios learned to breathe without needing to flatten anything.

“Hold the hum,” Jin said. “We’ll take the singing later.”

“I need the chorus,” Nia said into the common band, voice threaded with pain and calm. “If we go thin when the clamps bite, we do it with people. Three‑on, two‑off. Leader sits if wounded. No heroics—buffers, not martyrs.”

Ravi cut a tuned segment. The node went dark. “Baselines secured,” he said. “Ghost is burned. We owe you a relay.”

Helios exhaled again. The seed answered with memory. Somewhere a dampener called that a fault. No one here did.
