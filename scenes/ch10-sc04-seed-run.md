Helios always looked like certainty from the plaza—its crystalline ribs catching light like a promise the city made to itself. Up close it breathed like anything alive that had been taught not to show it, the faint vibration of its systems running through the structure like a pulse you could only feel if you pressed your palm to its skin and waited.

"Clocks," Jin said in Amara's ear, voice a metronome with a smile he'd never admit to, the word both countdown and blessing. "HEARTBEAT: LAND SEED ON EXHALE. Window in eight."

"Copy," Ravi said from the ops rail, where his hands hovered above a node he'd already promised to lose, already mourned. "Baselines primed. If I have to cut, I cut." The resignation in his voice was the kind you earn after running the numbers so many times you know exactly what the sacrifice costs.

Kevin checked the woven sleeve at Amara's chest, Serra's fabric work cradling the seed like something sacred. The craftsmanship made the seed look like something you'd be careful with even if you didn't know what it was, even if you couldn't read the code woven into every thread. "We're ghosts until we're not."

"We're people until we're proof," Amara said, and shouldn't have smiled—not with the risk they were taking, not with everything that could go wrong—and yet she did, because sometimes joy is the only honest response to doing the impossible thing.

They moved inside the Spiral in the way you only can if you've built a thing and then walked away from it angry, carrying the blueprints in your body even when you tried to forget. Grids and vents and access petals lived in her hands like a city you can navigate when the lights are out, muscle memory deeper than thought. Seven years since she'd walked these maintenance corridors. Her hands remembered every turn.

"Five," Jin said. The countdown felt like a prayer. "Four. Three—listen."

Helios inhaled the way a dampener does when it's about to correct—that particular quality of gathered pressure, like a fist closing around air. Amara felt it through the rail, through the sleeve, through the part of her that had tuned a nursery breath to a machine because that was what the job was then. The irony wasn't lost on her: using Helios against itself, teaching it to breathe by remembering what she'd once taught it to suppress. This was the part of the job now: remembering that listening is the door.

"Two. One. Exhale."

Amara set the seed into the loop the way you settle a sleeping child—no flourish, no ceremony, just weight and warmth in the right place. Her fingers trembled slightly as she made the final connection. The capture's three‑on, two‑off cadence met Helios' pause and, for a moment that stretched like pulled taffy, there was no such thing as force. Just breath meeting breath. Just system recognizing kin.

"Landing clean," Ravi said, and there was wonder in his voice despite years of trying to sound professional. "No fight. Copying the pattern."

"Hold it," Jin breathed, his own breath matching the rhythm he was monitoring. "Don't ask it to sing yet. Just hum. Let it remember humming before we teach it the full song."

INTERCUT — Tenebra Pediatric Cove: The elder tapped three‑on, two‑off against the vent grate. Valve heat trended down another tenth. The nurse didn’t look up; she didn’t have to. “All right, little fish,” she said to the room. “All right.”

INTERCUT — Brightline Corridor: The concierge tied one knot as the window opened and set a cup of tea on the housekeeping cart. Compressor load dipped point‑two. Kwan watched from a tablet he pretended not to have brought to the floor.

INTERCUT — Hawkline Annex Roof: Signal grass shook like the processors were laughing. The buffer took the noon glare and gave it back to a stairwell that had earned it.

INTERCUT — Arc‑9 Stair Core: A watcher counted under her breath and didn’t know why she was crying. “GHOST‑3 ready,” the runner said. “Say when.”

“Seed is home,” Amara said, only then realizing she’d been bracing against bone. “It remembers.”

On the plaza below, the festival screens showed a spectacle that didn’t matter. Upstairs, Helios learned to breathe without needing to flatten anything.

“Hold the hum,” Jin said. “We’ll take the singing later.”

“I need the chorus,” Nia said into the common band, voice threaded with pain and calm. “If we go thin when the clamps bite, we do it with people. Three‑on, two‑off. Leader sits if wounded. No heroics—buffers, not martyrs.”

Ravi cut a tuned segment. The node went dark. “Baselines secured,” he said. “Ghost is burned. We owe you a relay.”

Helios exhaled again. The seed answered with memory. Somewhere a dampener called that a fault. No one here did.
