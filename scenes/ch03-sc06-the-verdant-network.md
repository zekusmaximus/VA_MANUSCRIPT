The abandoned research center wore ruin like camouflage, just as surveys claimed. Vines tracked movement; bioluminescent whispers mapped air and heat. Elena stepped from the shadow, living circuits faint on her skin, and led Amara through reverse‑blooming doors into a corridor of living guides and ozone tang.
      "Part building, part organism," Elena said as moss membranes tuned filtration to their microbiomes. "Optimization can't see what grows past its brief."
      The central chamber opened like an inverted forest—walls pulsing data through tissue, crystal workstations alive with light, people moving with integrations tuned to the person, not the standard.
      "Welcome to the spaces between," Kevin said from a living data node.
      "Power requirements—" Amara began, watching botanical networks do more with less.
      "Minimal when you stop locking systems down," Nia said, conducting photosynthesis and data with her hands. "Your papers pointed here."
      A data node pulsed danger. "Corporate drones," Jin called. "New search over Sector 7."
      Displays shifted to familiar code—her monitoring protocols retooled for control. Patterns mapped through meshes she'd designed for growth, not pacing.
      "Two days to the vote," Kevin said. "They're not waiting."
      In living light, Amara saw precision she'd once prized and another kind of power: messy, alive, real.
      "Show me everything," she said.
