      Dawn came to Luminara in waves of light and data. The sun's first rays caught the city's solar arrays, creating a cascade of power signatures that rippled through Amara's monitoring feeds. But other lights moved against the natural flow   corporate drones, their precise formations casting geometric shadows across the awakening city.
      "Three more communities went dark overnight," Jin reported from his security station. The Network's living walls pulsed with shared tension as his displays mapped the spreading corporate influence in shades of red. "Dr. Veltri's new protocols are moving faster than predicted."
      "Not just faster," Amara said, watching patterns shift across her tablet. "Smarter." She recognized her mentor's elegant coding style in the drone formations   the same principles they'd once used to map neural networks, now turned to mapping resistance.
      The Network's command center had transformed since last night's decision. What had been a space for planning was now alive with coordinated action. Elena's historical databases flowed through Nia's botanical interfaces. Ravi's security systems merged with community power networks. Each member contributing their unique perspective to their shared defense.
      "Look at this," Kevin called, drawing their attention to the central display. The Hidden Garden's neural networks were evolving, spawning new connection patterns that spread through unofficial channels. Other communities had begun replicating the adaptations, creating a web of living data that corporate sensors struggled to track.
      "They're learning from each other," Nia said, pride mixing with concern in her voice. "But so is she." She highlighted a new drone scan pattern that mimicked natural growth cycles. "These aren't just corporate protocols anymore. They're..."
      "Hybridized," Amara finished, recognizing the underlying architecture. "She's combining their optimization algorithms with our biological systems." Through her neural interface, she felt the city's networks responding to this new threat   not just defending, but adapting, evolving.
      A sudden surge of power drew their attention to Sector 7. The old reactor site pulsed with unexpected activity, its dormant systems stirring after decades of artificial sleep.
      "That's impossible," Ravi muttered, checking readings. "Those systems were decommissioned years ago."
      But Amara's tablet told a different story. Beneath the surface decay, ancient neural networks were awakening. The reactor's original architecture   designed to work with natural processes rather than control them   was responding to corporate presence in ways their sensors couldn't fully map.
      "Not impossible," Kevin said, studying the patterns. "Living. Like the systems we adapted in the Wastelands. The corporate teams must have triggered something when they started their surveys."
      Elena moved to the historical displays, her weathered hands tracing patterns in the data. "The reactor was your first major project with Dr. Veltri, wasn't it?" she asked Amara. "Before optimization became more important than adaptation?"
      Before Amara could respond, Jin's security feeds lit up with new alerts. "Corporate forces converging on Sector 7. They're sending everything they have."
      The reactor's power signatures pulsed stronger, its awakening systems revealing sophisticated neural architecture that had evolved far beyond its original design. Architecture that could either save their resistance or give the corporate forces everything they needed to map and control every community network.
      "We need a team on site," Kevin said, already moving toward the equipment lockers. "Small group, minimal profile. If those systems are really waking up..."
      "They are." Amara's fingers moved through layers of data, recognizing patterns she'd helped design lifetime ago. "And they remember more than anyone thought possible." She looked up at Kevin. "I'm going with you."
      "Ravi and I too," Nia added, her botanical interfaces already adapting to stealth configurations. "You'll need both technical and biological expertise if those systems are as alive as they seem."
      Outside, corporate drones cast lengthening shadows as they moved into attack position. But through the Network's interfaces, Amara felt something else growing   communities connecting in new ways, living systems evolving faster than corporate forces could map them, hope spreading through hidden channels like sunrise through leaves.
      "Dawn patrol starts in four hours," Jin warned. "If you're going, it has to be now."
      Kevin met Amara's eyes across the command center. "Ready to revisit your old work, Engineer Solis?"
      She thought of Dr. Veltri in her corporate lab, using their shared knowledge to impose control on living systems. Thought of the communities fighting to maintain their independence, their right to grow and adapt on their own terms.
      "Ready to see what it's become," she corrected.
      The Network's living walls pulsed with morning light as they gathered their gear. Above them, corporate drones continued their precise patterns, searching for systems they could map and control. But below, in shadows and hidden places, in communities and forgotten reactors, something else was growing.
      Something wild.
      Something free.
      Something worth fighting for.
