The second settlement was the Hidden Garden's inverse. Where Kevin's people went down, these had gone up—homes woven into an abandoned arcology's bones. Solar fabric draped between levels like metallic Spanish moss, each fold learning the afternoon light.
      "The Hanging Gardens," Kevin said, guiding Amara along a walkway spun from recycled carbon fiber. "They took your solar optimization work and wove it into textiles."
      Children raced past, clothes shimmering with the settlement's same adaptive weave. Each step sent a whisper of power through hair‑thin conductors into the local grid.
      "The fabric responds to body temperature," Amara said, appreciation overtaking unease. "Storing heat for night conversion—"
      "Among other things." An elderly woman approached, silver hair woven with the same thread. "Serra. Welcome to my life's work, Engineer Solis."
      Amara recognized the name from technical journals, papers on biomimetic materials that she'd studied during Luminara's early days. "You disappeared from the academic feeds fifteen years ago."
      "Disappeared?" Serra laughed. "I've published more since leaving than I ever did inside—just not where corporate feeds bother to look." She gestured to the fabric forest. "Why argue theory when we can weave it into shade and power?"
      They followed Serra through levels of invention. Hydroponics used fabric capillaries for water and nutrients. Communication ran through the same threads that carried power. Every surface did at least two jobs, each adaptation feeding the next.
      "It's beautiful," Amara said. "Coordination with other settlements, though—the power for distance—"
      "Look closer," Kevin said, pointing where fabric stretched toward horizon. What read as simple collection resolved into patterned weaves carrying data—messages and resources passing as "noise" in corporate sensors.
      "The whole Wasteland is connected," Serra said. "Each place adding its own craft. The Garden's living circuits, our weaving, the Wind Tribe's thermal amplifiers—feeding one another. Growing together."
      Amara's tablet chirped, displaying a familiar signature. "Dr. Veltri was here," she said. It wasn't a question.
      "Three months ago." Serra's voice hardened. "Very interested in textile programming. Asked the right questions. Promised resource sharing and exchange."
      "And then?" Amara asked, though she already knew.
      "Then drones came to map our communication patterns. Testing. Looking for replication under controlled conditions." Serra touched a panel; it changed color under her fingers. "As if you can pin down something alive and still expect it to work."
      They climbed higher, eventually reaching a platform near the arcology's crown. From here, they could see other settlements scattered across the Wasteland, each one distinct, yet connected by invisible threads of power and data and human ingenuity.
      "Watch," Kevin said softly. As the sun dropped, settlements lit one by one—not harsh glare, but a soft pulse in harmony. "They're sharing power," he said. "Give what you can; take what you need. A living network."
      "Council calls it 'resource inefficiency,'" Serra said. "Your Dr. Veltri recommends standardization. Optimization." Her smile was sad. "As if life were an API."
      Amara watched the light ripple across the Wasteland, carrying messages and power and hope between communities. She thought of the Hidden Garden's living circuits, of the way these solar fabrics seemed to breathe, of all the innovations that had grown in the shadows of corporate control.
      "We need to document this," Amara said. "Not their way. Ours. Show the council what they're voting to erase."
      "It won't be easy," Kevin said. "Corporate systems ignore what they can't control."
      "Then we make them see." Amara's fingers moved, planning. "These connections aren't just survival. They're evolution—new ways to grow."
      A flash of movement caught her eye. On a nearby platform, a group of children were learning to program the solar fabric, their small hands weaving new patterns into the settlement's ever-growing network. Each mistake was met not with correction, but with curiosity, what new function might this unexpected pattern serve?
      Amara understood what she was seeing: not tools serving people, but people and tools evolving together, each making the other more alive.
      The sun sank lower, and Serra's fabric forest began its evening transformation, storing the day's last light for the night ahead. "Your mentor asked me once why I left the city," she said quietly. "I told her I wanted to see if photovoltaic textiles could be more efficient. I should have told her the truth."
      "Which is?"
      "That efficiency isn't the point. Connection is." Serra gestured at the glowing settlements, at the invisible web of sharing and growth and resilience that corporate algorithms could never fully map. "Everything connects. Everything grows. Everything evolves. Even power itself."
      Stars appeared, their light mixing with shared radiance. Somewhere, drones kept up their methodical mapping, trying to quantify what wouldn't hold still.
      Here—in fabric and light and stubborn care—Amara felt the future taking shape. Not in boardrooms, but in the space between official and unofficial, controlled and wild, what is and what could be.
      In patterns that grow in dust.
