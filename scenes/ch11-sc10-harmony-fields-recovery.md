Nia woke into a room that had learned her breath.

The light was a soft green from the wall garden, the kind of green that never scolded. Elena sat at the foot of the bed with a notebook open, not pretending the pencil was anything but a metronome. The apprentices hovered at thresholds the way good tenders do—present, not crowding—Maya with a ledger, Seve with a temperature wand, Lio with a coil of thread he’d braided into a loop while he waited.

“Say what hurts,” Elena said.

“Edges,” Nia answered. The word felt right in her mouth. Edges meant there were still borders to map. Sound returned as coins and static; scent arrived late, then all at once—the sting of salt, the sweet‑earth of root, the clean metal of a rail that had been listened to. Her interface lagged and then found her. She closed her eyes and let the delay teach her, like a new instrument: listening has a cost, and she had paid it on purpose.

Maya set the ledger on the blanket. The guardrails were written in a hand that would one day outlive Nia’s.

Leader sits if wounded.
Buffers, not martyrs.
Windows are not faults.
Rotation ≤ 15 minutes. Ghosts ≤ 60s/hr. One noncritical node may burn if it saves the breath—log it.

“Telemetry?” Nia asked, because pride without numbers felt like superstition.

Seve angled the ward screen so she could see it without lifting. “Compressor load: down 0.9% over four hours, stable.” He pointed with the wand. “Valve heat at Tenebra’s pediatric cove: down 0.1°C; trending flat. Brightline corridor complaints: down thirty‑two percent during window hours. Drift held inside ±0.3s except at altitude, where we widened to five beats and told the room why.”

“Hawkline?” Nia said, eyes half closed.

“Signal grass carried memory like we hoped.” Lio glanced at his own notes, ears pink. “The buffer took 0.7°C per ten meters into cloth; we returned it to stairwells on the off‑beats. We didn’t chase smooth lines. We let them learn.”

Nia smiled because Lio had used the exact words and because they had meant them. “And the seed run?”

“Landed on the exhale,” Maya said softly, as if speaking in a cathedral. “Ops read the dip in real time. We rode the beacons. And when your interface dropped, we kept cadence.” She looked Nia in the eye and did not look away. “Leader sits if wounded.”

Nia felt the pride barely fit in her chest. “You carried it.”

“We carried what you taught,” Seve said, cheeks going the color of the wall garden. “The room did the rest.”

Elena’s pencil clicked twice and then stilled. “We need to decide what goes in v1.1,” she said, already drawing boxes around a list. “Not just rules. Examples. Numbers that a concierge can feel right in their hands.”

Maya flipped the ledger to a clean page and began to write as if she’d been waiting to be told she was allowed. Nia dictated and the room listened.

Hands‑Forward Protocol v1.1 (Ward Edition)
— Leader sits if wounded. Rotation ≤ 15 minutes; stagger three‑on, two‑off. If ambient < 18°C, widen ±0.3s. At altitude, hold five beats.
— Materials: 2–3 shawls; saltwater; old cotton towels; cloth tags; charcoal for knot code. Record drift, buffer draw, and human notes.
— Buffer draw safe range: 0.5–1.0°C per ten meters of rail. If rails read colder, move contact to roots. If rails read hot, return heat to cloth.
— Ghost ceilings: ≤ 60s per hour. If you have to burn a noncritical node, log COST: ONE NODE in the ledger and tie a knot for remembrance.
— Watchers: define roles on shift; teach knot code; stipend forms live at the back of the ledger; do not apologize for pay.

“Add: ‘Do not chase smooth lines,’” Nia said. “Write, ‘Teach the memory instead.’ Put it where someone who wants to fix will have to read it twice.”

Elena wrote it herself, block letters neat enough to argue with. The pencil paused above the page. “What about your interface?”

“I’ll be loud for a while,” Nia said, pressing two fingers to the skin at her temple where the living circuit hummed like a distant transformer. “Highs and lows. Coins and static. A week or a month. The botanical ear has to learn my body again.” She inhaled and exhaled, watching how the room’s soft monitors answered her. “Cost logged. Worth it.”

Elena nodded once like a pact. “Then we log the cost in the protocol, not just in you.”

Lio came closer when she gestured. He held out the coil of thread like a child offering treasure. “I started this while we waited. For… ledger ties. Or for you.”

“For us,” Nia corrected gently, and looped it around the ledger’s spine. “Make a note of High Garden. The five‑beat window wasn’t a footnote. It was a mercy. Write mercy where they can see it.”

He wrote it and the word looked like a door.

A hum shifted in the wall garden—the old kind of noise that used to make systems clamp and now made them listen. A concierge stepped into the doorway with a stack of stipend forms and a posture that said she’d learned to walk through rooms like she belonged in them.

“We brought paperwork,” the concierge said with ceremonial gravity. “Watchers used to be invisible. Not anymore.”

Maya accepted the forms and tucked them into the ledger with more reverence than any liturgy. “We’ll show the others how to fill them without feeling like they’re stealing.”

“They aren’t,” Elena said. “They’re doing work the city forgot how to name.”

Seve adjusted the sensor that traced the wall garden’s breath. Numbers updated on the ward screen in a calm script that had learned not to shout. Compressor load tickled down another tenth. Valve heat stayed relaxed. Complaint volume for the corridor fell again during the window hour.

“When you stood down,” Nia said, almost to the room, almost to herself, “when my body stood down, it was still learning. It didn’t stop. It learned without me for a while.” She looked at her apprentices and felt something cede inside her that wasn’t defeat. “So will you.”

“We already are,” Maya said, not bragging.

Elena tied a quiet knot under the rail where the ward wall met the bed. The knot looked like a small, ordinary thing. The room listened and remembered.

Outside, the world moved at the new speed of care: ledger pages copied by kids with charcoal, stipend lines signed next to names that were never on forms before, a clinic that had once been told to round variance to zero and now measured mercy in beats and degrees. Inside, Nia closed her eyes and let the city breathe without her hand for a few breaths, the way you do when you trust the thing you built to hold.
