The festival's glow faded behind Amara as she entered Sector 7, replaced by the irregular flicker of aging photovoltaic streetlights. Her tablet's screen cast a harsh blue glow on cracked walkways, where stubborn moss grew in patterns too random to be part of the city's official biotecture. The sector had been one of Luminara's first, built before they'd perfected the integration of nature and technology. Now it served as an uncomfortable reminder of how quickly progress could leave places behind.
      "Power draw increasing," she muttered, following her readings deeper into the sector. "But where's it all going?"
      A soft green luminescence caught her eye, not the engineered bioluminescence of the festival, but something wilder. Something that shouldn't have been there at all. Amara rounded a corner and stopped short. The entire wall of an abandoned power substation was covered in flowering vines, their petals emitting a subtle glow that pulsed in an odd rhythm.
      "Beautiful, aren't they?" A woman's voice came from the shadows. "Helianthus noctiluca. They're not supposed to grow this far up in the city."
      A figure emerged from behind the vines. Her dark skin was marked with patterns of phosphorescent algae, not the fashionable kind from the city center, but something more purposeful. Each line followed what Amara recognized as power flow patterns.
      "You must be Nia," Amara said. Ravi had mentioned their environmental systems specialist. "I didn't expect to find you here."
      "The plants called me." Nia touched one of the glowing flowers. "They're sensitive to electromagnetic fluctuations. Been going crazy for weeks now." She gestured at the wall of vines. "This is the biggest cluster I've found yet."
      Amara frowned at her tablet. "The power readings are strongest here, but there's no official draw point. Nothing but the old substation, and it was decommissioned years ago."
      "Official readings don't tell the whole story." Nia pulled aside a curtain of vines, revealing the substation's access panel. "Look at the growth pattern. The flowers are drawn to power like moths to flame. And they're all leaning toward..."
      She didn't need to finish. Amara was already scanning the panel with her tablet. "This is impossible. The substation's supposedly cold, but there's massive power flowing through it. Someone's reconstructed the entire internal grid."
      "Not someone," Nia said quietly. "Something. Look at this."
      She pointed to a small corporate logo, barely visible beneath the vines. The stylized sun of Solace Industries gleamed dully in the flowers' light.
      Amara's tablet chirped an alert. The power fluctuations were spiking again, stronger than ever. Above them, the remaining functional streetlights dimmed momentarily.
      "It's not just here," Nia said. She walked to the edge of the sector's boundary, where the city's floating platforms gave way to open air. "Look."
      Amara joined her at the railing. Below, beyond Luminara's gleaming edges, the Wastelands stretched into darkness. But not complete darkness. Points of light flickered in the distance, jury-rigged solar collectors and wind turbines, she realized. Unofficial power networks, serving those the city had left behind.
      "The same pattern," she breathed, seeing it now. "The power's being siphoned from the old substations, but it's not going to the Wastelands. It's being... measured. Studied."
      "They're mapping the unofficial networks," Nia said. "All of them. The plants show the same disruption patterns everywhere these substations are active." She touched one of the glowing flowers gently. "Nature always notices when something's wrong. We just have to learn to listen."
      Amara's mind raced back to the festival, to Kevin's demonstration of power flow. To the way he'd emphasized connection and community. He must have known about this. About how vulnerable the unofficial networks were. About what it would mean if someone gained control of them.
      Her tablet screen flickered, displaying a new message from Ravi. The festival's power draw was reaching critical levels, far beyond what should have been possible. And here, in this forgotten corner of the city, she could see exactly how they were doing it.
      "We need to get back to the festival," she said, already turning to go. But she paused, looking at the wall of illuminated flowers. "The plants, how long have they been warning us?"
      "Since the first corporate upgrades arrived," Nia replied. "But sometimes the most important signals are the ones we're trained to ignore."
      Amara nodded slowly. She'd spent years learning Luminara's systems, memorizing every protocol and procedure. But standing here, watching unauthorized flowers glow with stolen power, she wondered how much she'd missed by looking only at official readings.
      Behind them, the festival's lights painted the sky in celebratory colors. But here in Sector 7, in the company of rogue plants and hidden networks, Amara began to understand just how deep the shadows in her shining city went.
      She took one last look at the Wastelands below, thinking of Kevin's words about connection and community. The real power of Luminara wasn't in its official grid or its corporate upgrades. It was in all the small lights in the darkness, all the unofficial connections, all the ways people found to share energy and hope.
      And someone was trying to map it all, to control it all, to turn it into something else entirely.
      The flowers pulsed their warning into the night, and Amara finally knew how to listen.
