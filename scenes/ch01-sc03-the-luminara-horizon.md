The festival's glow thinned behind Amara as she stepped into Sector 7, traded for the irregular pulse of aging photovoltaic lamps. Her tablet threw hard blue across cracked walkway panels where moss clung in emergent whorls—not the tidy signatures of sanctioned biotecture. One of Luminara's first sectors, this place kept the city's early experiments like scars: promising, imperfect, alive. Progress had moved on; the corner had kept listening.
      "Power draw increasing," she muttered, following her readings deeper into the sector. "But where's it all going?"
      A soft green luminescence tugged at her peripheral vision—not festival polish, but something wilder. She rounded a corner and stopped. An abandoned substation wall had vanished beneath flowering vines, petals exhaling light in a rhythm that wasn't the grid's.
      "Beautiful, aren't they?" A woman's voice came from the shadows. "Helianthus noctiluca. They're not supposed to grow this far up in the city."
      A figure stepped from behind the vines. Her dark skin carried faint phosphorescent tracings that followed load paths and eddies; not center‑city ornament, but instrumentation on skin.
      "You must be Nia," Amara said. Ravi had mentioned their environmental systems specialist. "I didn't expect to find you here."
      "The plants called me." Nia brushed a glowing petal; the pulse shifted as if answering. "They're hypersensitive to EM drift. Weeks of agitation." She nodded to the wall. "Biggest cluster yet."
      Amara frowned at her tablet. "Strongest readings center here, but there's no official draw. The substation's marked cold—decommissioned years ago."
      "Official channels don't hear everything." Nia parted a curtain of vines, revealing the access panel. "Look at the growth. They're leaning into a leak—"
      She didn't need to finish. Amara scanned. "Cold on paper, warm in the wires." She magnified a schematic trace. "The internal grid's been re‑knit."
      "Not someone," Nia said softly. "Something." 
      She pointed to a half‑occluded stamp beneath the vines: the stylized sun of Solace Industries, dulled by pollen and time.
      Amara's tablet chirped. Spikes again—steeper. Above them, the few working streetlights dipped and steadied, as if catching breath.
      "It's not just here," Nia said. She walked to the edge of the sector's boundary, where the city's floating platforms gave way to open air. "Look."
      Amara joined her at the railing. Beyond Luminara's bright skin, the Wastelands stretched outward—dark, then not dark. A scatter of lights flickered to life and faded: jury‑rigged collectors, scavenged turbines, batteries that learned the weather by touch. A patchwork constellation serving those the city hadn't.
      "The same rhythm," she breathed. "Old substations as catch‑points. Not feeding the Wastelands—instrumenting them."
      "They're tracing the unofficial networks," Nia said. "Everywhere these hubs hum, the plants echo the disturbance." She touched a blossom; its glow synced with the distant flicker. "Living systems notice first. Our job is to pay attention."
      Amara's mind raced back to the festival, to Kevin's demonstration of power flow. To the way he'd emphasized connection and community. He must have known about this. About how vulnerable the unofficial networks were. About what it would mean if someone gained control of them.
      Her tablet flickered: a message from Ravi. Festival draw near critical, numbers beyond spec. Here, in this quiet corner, the method revealed itself line by line.
      "We need to get back to the festival," she said, already turning—then paused, eye on the illuminated wall. "How long have they been warning us?"
      "Since the first corporate upgrades," Nia said. "We were trained to ignore signals that didn't fit the dashboard."
      Amara nodded. She'd memorized every protocol, tuned her attention to sanctioned telemetry. Here, with unauthorized flowers translating current to color, she counted the things she'd missed by listening only up the chain.
      Behind them, festival lights painted the sky with cheerful surplus. Here in Sector 7, among rogue plants and hidden lines, the city's shadows resolved into legible patterns.
      She looked once more toward the Wastelands, hearing Kevin's insistence on connection. Luminara's power wasn't in logos or upgrades. It lived in the small lights, the unofficial lines, the ways people taught energy to circulate like care.
      And someone was tracing it, pacing it, preparing to teach it a single beat.
      The flowers kept pulsing their quiet code into the night, and Amara found she could read it.
