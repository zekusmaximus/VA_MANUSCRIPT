The festival's glow thinned behind Amara as she stepped into Sector 7, the transition happening in stages like walking from one season into another. First the bioluminescent crowds thinned, then the carefully tended gardens gave way to wilder growth, and finally the warm amber streetlamps were traded for the irregular pulse of aging photovoltaic lamps that flickered like uncertain heartbeats.

Her tablet threw hard blue across cracked walkway panels where moss clung in emergent whorls—not the tidy signatures of sanctioned biotecture but something that had learned to grow here without permission. The moss was thicker in some cracks than others, following patterns that had more to do with leaked condensation from underground pipes than any designer's intention. Amara stepped carefully, her engineer's eye reading the infrastructure beneath: old water lines running too close to the surface, thermal vents that had settled incorrectly and now breathed heat through gaps in the pavement.

One of Luminara's first sectors, this place kept the city's early experiments like scars: promising, imperfect, alive. The buildings here predated the neural mesh integration, their systems running on older code that couldn't quite talk to the newer grid. You could see it in how the lights came on—stuttering instead of smooth, each building making its own decision about when darkness had arrived. Progress had moved on to the shinier districts with their synchronized systems. The corner had kept listening to its own rhythms.
      "Power draw increasing," she muttered, following her readings deeper into the sector. "But where's it all going?"
      A soft green luminescence tugged at her peripheral vision—not the polished bioluminescence of festival fashion but something wilder, more urgent. She rounded a corner and stopped. An abandoned substation wall had vanished beneath flowering vines, their petals exhaling light in a rhythm that wasn't the grid's. The glow pulsed: bright, dim, bright-bright, dim, a syncopated pattern that looked organic but felt deliberate.

She brushed a glowing petal and the pulse shifted as if answering her touch, the rhythm changing to match where her fingers made contact. The vine was warm, alive in the usual sense but also responding to something underneath—electromagnetic drift bleeding through the wall. "Hypersensitive to EM drift," she said to herself, pulling up her tablet's field sensor. "Weeks of agitation. These plants have been soaking in leaked current long enough to adapt."

Amara frowned at her tablet, cross-referencing the bloom pattern with grid records. "Strongest readings center here, but there's no official draw. The substation's marked cold—decommissioned three years ago after the district upgrade." Yet her sensors read active current, substantial load, heat signature consistent with live equipment running hard.

She parted a curtain of vines to reveal a sealed access panel. Dust coated the metal where the vines hadn't reached, and beneath it, pollen clung to a faint emboss like gold leaf on old paint. She wiped with her sleeve, feeling the raised metal emerge under her fingertips until a stylized sun resolved: Solace Industries. Exactly where a diagnostic port shouldn't be. The city's grid used open protocols, shared standards. Corporate proprietary hardware had no place in public infrastructure. Yet here it was, sealed behind dust and flowering evidence.
      She scanned. "Cold on paper, warm in the wires." The internal grid read re‑knit under the dash.
      Her tablet chirped. Spikes again—steeper. Above her, the few working streetlights dipped and steadied together, like a caught breath released.
      She walked to the sector edge where platforms gave way to open air, where Luminara's careful architecture simply stopped and the ground dropped away toward the buffer zone. Beyond Luminara's bright skin, the Wastelands stretched—dark at first glance, but not dark once your eyes adjusted. Scattered lights flickered and faded across the rough terrain: jury‑rigged solar collectors angled to catch morning light, scavenged turbines spinning in wind that Luminara's towers blocked, batteries cobbled together from salvaged cells that learned the weather by touch because there was no grid to tell them when to charge.

A patchwork constellation serving those the city hadn't. Or wouldn't. The boundary wasn't official—there were no walls, no fences, just the place where maintained infrastructure gave up and people had to make do with what they could build themselves. Kevin had come from out there, had taught himself engineering from salvaged manuals and trial and error, had arrived in Luminara with callused hands and sharp questions about why abundance stopped at invisible lines.

Amara pulled up her data, overlaying the Wasteland lights with Sector 7's power signature. "Same rhythm," she breathed, watching the patterns sync. "Old substations as catch‑points. Not feeding the Wastelands—instrumenting them. Mapping their systems." Someone was measuring the informal grid, learning its patterns, documenting how power moved through the gray zone where official and unofficial infrastructure touched.
      Her tablet flickered: a message from Ravi. Festival draw near critical, numbers beyond spec. Here, in this quiet corner, the method revealed itself line by line.
      "We need to get back to the festival," she said, eyes returning to the stamped sun beneath the film of pollen. She'd memorized every protocol, tuned her attention to sanctioned telemetry. Here, with unauthorized flowers translating current to color, she counted what she'd missed by listening only up the chain.
      Behind her, festival lights painted the sky with cheerful surplus, the glow visible even from here. Here in Sector 7, among rogue plants and hidden lines, the city's shadows resolved into legible patterns. This was the grid she'd thought she knew—the one she'd spent years building and tuning—revealing infrastructure she'd never mapped, connections she'd never authorized, a whole parallel network running underneath the official one.

She looked once more toward the Wastelands, hearing Kevin's voice in her memory: whose city is this? Luminara's power wasn't in logos or upgrades. It lived in the small lights, the unofficial lines, the ways people taught energy to circulate like care. She'd designed systems to share within boundaries. Someone else was learning to share across them. Or to control them. The difference mattered.

And someone was tracing it all, pacing it, preparing to teach the whole entangled system to keep a single beat.

The flowers kept pulsing their quiet code into the night—bright, dim, bright-bright, dim—and Amara found she could read it now. Not the specific meaning, not yet, but the shape of the question: what happens when you map every breath a city takes? She walked back toward the festival with that rhythm in her bones, the glowing vines still visible in her peripheral vision like an afterimage made of questions.
