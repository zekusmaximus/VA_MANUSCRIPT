The festival's glow thinned behind Amara as she stepped into Sector 7, traded for the irregular pulse of aging photovoltaic lamps. Her tablet threw hard blue across cracked walkway panels where moss clung in emergent whorls—not the tidy signatures of sanctioned biotecture. One of Luminara's first sectors, this place kept the city's early experiments like scars: promising, imperfect, alive. Progress had moved on; the corner had kept listening.
      "Power draw increasing," she muttered, following her readings deeper into the sector. "But where's it all going?"
      A soft green luminescence tugged at her peripheral vision—not festival polish, but something wilder. She rounded a corner and stopped. An abandoned substation wall had vanished beneath flowering vines, petals exhaling light in a rhythm that wasn't the grid's.
      She brushed a glowing petal; the pulse shifted as if answering. "Hypersensitive to EM drift," she said to herself. "Weeks of agitation."
      Amara frowned at her tablet. "Strongest readings center here, but there's no official draw. The substation's marked cold—decommissioned years ago."
      She parted a curtain of vines to reveal a sealed access panel. Dust coated the metal; beneath it, pollen clung to a faint emboss. She wiped with her sleeve until a stylized sun resolved: Solace Industries. Exactly where a diagnostic port shouldn't be.
      She scanned. "Cold on paper, warm in the wires." The internal grid read re‑knit under the dash.
      Her tablet chirped. Spikes again—steeper. Above her, the few working streetlights dipped and steadied together, like a caught breath released.
      She walked to the sector edge where platforms gave way to open air. Beyond Luminara's bright skin, the Wastelands stretched—dark, then not dark. Scattered lights flickered and faded: jury‑rigged collectors, scavenged turbines, batteries that learned the weather by touch. A patchwork constellation serving those the city hadn't.
      "Same rhythm," she breathed. "Old substations as catch‑points. Not feeding the Wastelands—instrumenting them."
      Her tablet flickered: a message from Ravi. Festival draw near critical, numbers beyond spec. Here, in this quiet corner, the method revealed itself line by line.
      "We need to get back to the festival," she said, eyes returning to the stamped sun beneath the film of pollen. She'd memorized every protocol, tuned her attention to sanctioned telemetry. Here, with unauthorized flowers translating current to color, she counted what she'd missed by listening only up the chain.
      Behind her, festival lights painted the sky with cheerful surplus. Here in Sector 7, among rogue plants and hidden lines, the city's shadows resolved into legible patterns.
      She looked once more toward the Wastelands, hearing Kevin's insistence on connection. Luminara's power wasn't in logos or upgrades. It lived in the small lights, the unofficial lines, the ways people taught energy to circulate like care.
      And someone was tracing it, pacing it, preparing to teach it a single beat.
      The flowers kept pulsing their quiet code into the night, and Amara found she could read it.
