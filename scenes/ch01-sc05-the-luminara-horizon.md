      Amara's apartment occupied the highest residential level of Sector 4, a location that had once felt like a reward for her contributions to the city. Now, watching Luminara's lights flicker in the pre-dawn hours, it felt more like a gilded cage. Her living walls, usually responsive to her presence, seemed oddly still, as if they too sensed something wrong in the city's rhythms.
      She'd spread her work across the apartment's main room, multiple tablets displaying data from the night's events. The festival's power readings, Sector 7's anomalies, Nia's plant responses, all pieces of a puzzle she was finally beginning to understand. Her own mug of algae tea sat cold and forgotten beside her makeshift command center.
      Her eyes drifted to the small biotecture sample still growing on her desk, her first successful design, the one Veltri had helped her nurture. Its leaves still reached for light exactly as they had in the beginning, unchanged by corporate protocols or efficiency metrics. "Some things stay true to their nature," Veltri had said back then. The memory tasted bitter now.
      "Show me the pattern," she murmured, fingers dancing across the screens. "Show me what we missed."
      She overlaid the festival's power drain with Sector 7's fluctuations, then added the electromagnetic signatures Nia's flowers had detected. The combined data showed more than just similarity to the old reactor's patterns, it revealed how someone was using those patterns as a skeleton key, testing each neural pathway for weaknesses, mapping the city's living responses. A systematic dissection of everything that made Luminara unique.
      "That's impossible," she whispered, but the evidence was undeniable. She'd seen these signatures before, in the early days of Luminara's construction. The energy flow matched the original reactor's neural network perfectly, the same reactor she and Veltri had designed together, the one that had been supposedly decommissioned years ago.
      Someone hadn't just reactivated the old system. They were using it as a template, a blueprint for something bigger. Each power fluctuation was a test, a probe, learning how Luminara's living systems responded to stress. Once they understood those responses, they could control them. Replace them. Standardize them.
      Her tablet chimed with an encrypted message. For a moment, she thought it might be Veltri, but the signature was unfamiliar:
      The Wasteland sees what Luminara ignores. We've been watching the same patterns. Meet tomorrow at dawn, east sector boundary. Bring what you've found.
      Amara caught her reflection in the window, tired eyes, tangled curls, the weight of discovery visible in her shoulders. Beyond her image, the city was waking. Solar arrays stirred, tracking the first hints of dawn. Wind turbines adjusted their angles, preparing for the morning breeze. A living city, still breathing, still growing, despite everything happening beneath its shining surface.
      Her comm unit lit up with a priority message from the council. Tomorrow's agenda: Vote on Solace Industries' integration proposal. Full attendance required. The message might as well have been a countdown timer. Once Solace's integration began, there would be no way to untangle their protocols from the city's neural networks. What they started in Sector 7 would spread everywhere, replacing every organic adaptation, every community connection, with corporate-controlled efficiency.
      She thought of Veltri's words about progress and necessity, of Kevin's demonstration of community power, of Nia's flowers glowing with stolen energy. The city she'd helped build was balanced on a knife's edge, and she had to choose which way it would fall.
      Her living walls finally stirred, their leaves turning toward the rising sun like they had every morning since she'd first grown them. She watched their movement, remembering how long it had taken to get the response patterns right. Not by controlling them, but by understanding them. By letting them show her what they needed.
      Some patterns couldn't be rewritten, no matter how hard you tried to control them.
      The sun was rising over Luminara, painting the city gold once again. But this time, Amara saw past the glittering surface to the shadows beneath, to the people working in those shadows, to the truth about power and who wielded it.
      She began typing her response to the Verdant Network, each word a step away from the path she'd thought she'd follow, toward something both frightening and necessary:
      I'll be there. And I'm not coming alone. The council needs to see what's really happening in Sector 7.
      Her apartment's smart systems began their morning cycle, soft lights brightening to ease the transition to day. But Amara was already gathering what she needed for a different kind of awakening. She downloaded the reactor data to a secure drive, packed her diagnostic tools, and, after a moment's hesitation, took the small biotecture sample from her desk. A reminder of what they'd once believed in, what they'd tried to build.
      The day was beginning. And with it, the real work would too.
      She took one last look at her city, their city, before turning to prepare. Tomorrow, she would see the Wastelands for herself, would face the human cost of Luminara's bright dream. Tomorrow, she would learn what it truly meant to power a city, to connect its people, to fight for its soul.
      Tomorrow couldn't come soon enough.
