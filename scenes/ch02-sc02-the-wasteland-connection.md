The sun climbed and Luminara turned its mirrored faces to meet it—arrays gleaming, algae farms drinking light. Amara watched the spaces between those systems, where unofficial currents threaded like mycelium. Something was growing there.
      Maybe the future hid in those seams.
      Luminara looked different from the outside. At Sector 7's edge, where platforms gave way to open air, she tried to hold both truths at once: from within, a triumph of sustained care; from here, the geometry of its shadows.
      "Beautiful, isn't it?" Kevin's voice carried an edge she hadn't heard during the Network meeting. "The way it floats above everything it left behind."
      The transport platform hummed, salvaged gravitics tuned like a vintage instrument. Another assumption about Wasteland tech, revised.
      "We don't have much time," Ravi reminded them from his position at the Network's monitoring station. "The next drone sweep starts in four hours."
      Amara checked her tablet one more time. From here the pattern resolved: official channels braided with a web of unofficial lines that led from city skin down into the open.
      "Ready?" Kevin asked, offering his hand to help her onto the platform.
      She ignored it, stepping on. "Show me how you modified my reactor design."
      The platform dropped through banks of mist. Filtered air gave way to something raw: dust and green, not curated plantings but wild persistence.
      "Watch," Kevin said, trimming their course. They slipped through a shaft of sun and the ground below reassembled: what read as debris became a cascade of disguised solar collectors, surfaces dressed as scrap for eyes that scanned from above.
      "Camouflage," Amara said, interest warming her voice. "But the power to run adaptive surfaces—"
      "Is manageable when you stop trying to fix every variable in place." Kevin's voice softened. "Sometimes evolution outruns engineering."
      Heat buffeted them; the platform compensated. Temperature spiked and settled on her tablet. "Waste heat from the city," she said. "You're harvesting the bloom."
      "Among other things." Kevin banked them to reveal towers masquerading as relics—vertical farms inside—and "trash" heaps that hid careful water reclamation.
      "All of this," Amara said, taking in the hidden lattice, "ties into Sector 7's pattern?"
      "Everything connects." Kevin's smile was thin. "Official and unofficial were always one fabric. People adapt. Systems follow, or they break."
      They cut another layer of mist and her tablet lit: networks she'd never mapped, power flowing through paths the city would insist did not exist.
      "Impossible," she breathed. "These efficiencies—"
      "—outperform Luminara in places," Kevin finished. "Necessity teaches fast. Faster than corporate optimization."
      Lower now, they crossed a field that read as dead scrub until pattern recognition clicked: brittle stalks angled to catch and guide water, roots braided into living conduits.
      "The assessment called this wasteland," she said. "Dead zones. Sinks."
      "We let them," Kevin said, years of careful resistance in the words. "Sensors miss what they don't know to ask."
      They banked around a mountain of debris and Amara's breath caught. In its shadow, a shape she knew—her reactor—rewritten as something organic, almost alive.
      "That's impossible," she said again. "Containment alone—"
      "—would be with your baseline," Kevin agreed. "We modified." He angled them toward a concealed pad. "Ready to see how the other half lives, Engineer Solis?"
      Her tablet lit: proximity alert. At scanning range's edge, corporate drones began their sweep. Right on schedule.
      "Don't worry," Kevin said, catching her tension. "They don't look closely at what they think they understand." He tapped a control. Rock opened; they vanished inside. "And they understand less than you do."
      Stone sealed behind them. The space beyond defied what she'd filed under Wasteland tech. Under adaptation. Under power.
      "Welcome," Kevin said softly, "to the Hidden Garden."
      Around them, bioluminescent algae pulsed in almost‑familiar patterns—stories her training had never taught her to read. Survival. Adaptation. Power that grows in shadows.
      She found herself ready to learn.
