The sun rose higher over Luminara, its light catching the solar arrays and algae farms that powered the city's official systems. But Amara's attention was on the shadows between them, where other kinds of power flowed. Where something new was growing.
      Where the real future might be hiding.
      Luminara looked different from the outside. Amara stood at the edge of Sector 7's boundary, where the city's floating platforms gave way to open air, and tried to reconcile the two versions of her home. From within, it was a triumph of sustainable engineering. From here, she could see the shadows it cast.
      "Beautiful, isn't it?" Kevin's voice carried an edge she hadn't heard during the Network meeting. "The way it floats above everything it left behind."
      The transport platform he'd brought hummed quietly, its salvaged gravitics perfectly maintained despite their apparent age. Another assumption about Wasteland technology she'd need to revise.
      "We don't have much time," Ravi reminded them from his position at the Network's monitoring station. "The next drone sweep starts in four hours."
      Amara checked her tablet one last time, comparing power readings from their position to the anomalies she'd been tracking. The patterns were clearer from here, energy flowing not just through official channels but through a complex web of unofficial connections that stretched from the city into the wastes below.
      "Ready?" Kevin asked, offering his hand to help her onto the platform.
      She ignored it, making the step herself. "Let's see these modifications to my reactor design."
      The platform descended slowly through banks of morning mist. The city's filtered air gave way to something rawer, carrying scents of dust and growing things. Not the carefully engineered plants of Luminara's gardens, but something wilder.
      "Watch this," Kevin said, adjusting their course slightly. The platform passed through a shaft of sunlight, and suddenly the landscape below transformed. What had looked like random debris revealed itself as a cascade of cleverly disguised solar collectors, their surfaces designed to look like waste metal from above.
      "Camouflage tech," Amara noted, professional interest overriding her caution. "But the power requirements for that kind of adaptive surface "
      "Are perfectly manageable when you're not trying to control every variable." Kevin's voice softened slightly. "Sometimes evolution is more efficient than engineering."
      They passed through a layer of thermal turbulence, the platform compensating smoothly. Amara watched the temperature readings on her tablet spike and settle. "The heat bloom from the city's waste energy," she said. "You're harvesting it."
      "Among other things." Kevin adjusted their descent angle, revealing more hidden infrastructure. Towers that looked like abandoned industrial relics housed vertical farms. What appeared to be random trash piles contained sophisticated water reclamation systems.
      "All of this," Amara gestured at the hidden technology, "it's connected to the power anomalies in Sector 7?"
      "Everything's connected." Kevin's smile was grim. "That's what your friend Dr. Veltri never understood. You can't separate the official systems from the unofficial ones. People find ways to survive. To adapt."
      The platform passed through another bank of mist, and Amara's tablet suddenly lit up with new data. Networks she'd never seen before appeared on her screen, power flowing through pathways that shouldn't have existed.
      "Impossible," she breathed. "These readings... the efficiency rates..."
      "Are better than Luminara's in some areas," Kevin finished. "Turns out necessity is a better teacher than corporate optimization."
      They were lower now, passing through a field of what looked like dead vegetation. But Amara's engineering eye caught the patterns, the way each brittle stalk was positioned to collect and channel water, how the root systems formed living power conduits.
      "The corporate assessment said this was all wasteland," she said quietly. "Dead zones. Resource sinks."
      "And we let them think that." Kevin's voice carried years of careful resistance. "It's amazing what people overlook when they're only measuring what they understand."
      The platform banked around a massive pile of industrial debris, and Amara's breath caught. Hidden in its shadow was a structure she recognized, or thought she did. The basic shape matched her original reactor design, but it had been transformed into something organic, almost alive.
      "That's impossible," she said for the second time that morning. "The containment requirements alone "
      "Would be impossible with your original design," Kevin agreed. "But like I said, we made some modifications." He guided the platform toward a concealed landing pad. "Ready to see how the other half really lives, Engineer Solis?"
      Before she could answer, her tablet lit up with a proximity alert. Far above, at the edge of scanning range, corporate drones began their scheduled sweep of the sector boundary. Right on schedule, just as the Network had predicted.
      "Don't worry," Kevin said, noting her tension. "They never look closely at things they think they understand." He touched a control, and the platform disappeared into what looked like solid rock. "And they understand even less than you do."
      The hidden door sealed behind them, and Amara found herself in a space that defied everything she thought she knew about Wasteland technology. About adaptation. About power itself.
      "Welcome," Kevin said quietly, "to the Hidden Garden."
      Around them, bioluminescent algae began to pulse in patterns she almost recognized, telling stories her engineering training had never taught her to read. Stories about survival, adaptation, and the kind of power that grew in shadows.
      Stories she was finally ready to learn.
