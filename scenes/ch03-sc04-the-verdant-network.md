      The Network's strategy room felt too small for the tension it contained. Holographic displays showed Luminara's power grid in real-time, corporate influence spreading like frost across a window. The Memory Garden's data scrolled alongside current readings, past and present merging in streams of light.
      "We need to act now." Jin's voice cut through the murmur of discussion. The security specialist's algae marks pulsed with agitation. "Every hour we wait gives them more control over the grid."
      "Rushing in without proper preparation got New Alexandria wiped off the map," Elena countered, her weathered hands steady as she manipulated the historical overlay. "The Memory Garden showed us that pattern clearly enough."
      Amara studied both displays, seeing the truth in both arguments. The corporate protocols were advancing faster than predicted, but their historical data showed how direct confrontation had failed in other cities.
      "What about a targeted disruption?" Ravi suggested, pulling up Sector 7's subsystems. "We could use the old reactor signatures to..."
      "And risk the communities that depend on those networks?" Nia interrupted. Her botanical interfaces showed widespread disruption in the sector's living systems. "People's lives aren't theoretical data points."
      "Neither is corporate control," Jin shot back. "Ask the people of Rio how theoretical it felt when their community networks went dark."
      Kevin stood silent at the edge of the debate, watching the factions form. His eyes met Amara's across the room, carrying a weight of understanding. They'd seen this pattern too in the Memory Garden, how division could be as effective as direct control.
      "The council vote is in two days," Amara said, stepping into the center of the room. The displays shifted around her, showing the acceleration of corporate integration. "Dr. Veltri isn't waiting for approval. The protocols are already..."
      "Dr. Veltri," a young Network member scoffed. "Your mentor. Maybe that's why you're hesitating. Maybe loyalty..."
      "Careful," Kevin's voice was soft but carried an edge. "Engineer Solis has proven her commitment."
      "Have you?" Elena asked Amara directly. "The Memory Garden showed us your mentor's path. Are you certain you won't follow it?"
      The room went quiet. Amara felt the weight of history pressing down, not just the collected memories of resistance, but her own path from Luminara's bright towers to this underground chamber.
      "I've seen what corporate optimization really means," she said finally. "In the Hidden Garden, in Serra's settlement, in the Memory Garden's records. But I've also seen how direct confrontation fails. We need a different approach."
      "What kind of approach?" Jin demanded. "While we debate, they're mapping every independent network, every community connection..."
      "Exactly," Amara said. "They're mapping connections. So let's give them connections they can't map."
      She moved to the central display, fingers dancing through data streams. "Look at their pattern. They're using my old neural network designs, modified for control rather than adaptation. But the base architecture is still there. Still alive."
      Understanding dawned in Ravi's eyes. "You want to turn their mapping against them?"
      "Better." Amara pulled up the Hidden Garden's specs alongside Serra's textile networks. "I want to let them map everything. Every connection, every adaptation, every pattern of resistance and survival. Let them think they're building their perfect model."
      "And then?" Elena's voice carried both doubt and curiosity.
      "And then we show them what real adaptation looks like." Kevin stepped forward, seeing where Amara's logic led. "Not just individual communities resisting, but all of us evolving together. Becoming something their algorithms can't predict."
      "It's too risky," Jin argued. "If they complete their mapping before we're ready..."
      "They won't." Amara's hands shifted through the data, showing new patterns emerging. "Because we're not going to wait. Every scan, every probe, every attempt to map our networks, we turn it into an opportunity for connection. For growth they can't control."
      "The council vote..." Nia began.
      "Is part of their pattern," Amara finished. "But we don't need the council's permission to grow. To adapt. To become something stronger than control."
      The displays shifted again, showing the subtle ways communities were already connecting, already sharing adaptations. The Hidden Garden's living circuits linking with Serra's textile networks. Independent power collectives finding new ways to share resources. A web of resistance too organic, too alive to be fully mapped.
      "We can't wait for perfect consensus," Kevin said quietly. "But we can choose to trust each other. To grow together."
      Elena studied the patterns for a long moment. "It could work," she admitted. "Or it could give them exactly what they want, a complete map of everything we've built."
      "Then let them map it," Amara said. "Let them think they understand us. While we become something else entirely."
      The tension in the room shifted, not disappearing but transforming. Like the networks they were fighting to protect, the conflicts began to feel less like division and more like growth, different perspectives finding new ways to connect.
      "Two days," Jin said finally. "That's all the time we have before the vote."
      "Then let's make them count," Kevin replied. "Not just in Luminara, but everywhere. Every community, every network, every act of resistance becoming part of something larger."
      Amara felt it then, the same resonance she'd experienced in the Memory Garden, but stronger now. Not just the weight of history, but the potential of the future. A future they would have to grow into together, even if they didn't all agree on the path.
      The displays pulsed with new data: corporate drones increasing their scanning patterns, optimization protocols spreading faster through official channels. But underneath those controlled patterns, something else was growing. Something that felt like hope, like defiance, like the first shoots of spring breaking through winter frost.
      Something that couldn't be mapped, couldn't be controlled, couldn't be optimized.
      Something alive.
