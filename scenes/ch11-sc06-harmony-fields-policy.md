The chamber was quieter than during any vote that had promised to change the world. It felt like a room adjusting the angle of a trellis rather than planting a new tree.

“For the record,” the Chair said, “the statute text as amended.”

Statute 17‑B (Breath Windows): Windows are not faults. Listening is not error. Operating systems shall not classify sanctioned variance windows as failure conditions. All clamps shall respect documented windows and heartbeat timing where applicable.

Addendum A (Guardrails): Rotation caps, salt‑scrub hygiene, noncritical node sacrifice limits, ghosting ceilings (≤ 60s/hr), ledgers and watchers’ knot code recognized as valid operational signals.

Addendum B (Watchers): Define Watcher (concierge/janitor/elder/volunteer) as a formal operational role during window hours; provide training, access to knot code, and a modest stipend; require pilot budget lines to include Watchers.

Technical Advisory (Recorded): Publish variance amplifier as an optional patch note (“no keys”); heartbeat‑respecting; widen breath in slow corridors by ≤ 0.5s; advisory only.

Kwan cleared his throat. “On behalf of Brightline Towers, we will log that our complaint volume dropped thirty‑two percent under windows and our compressors run cooler by nearly one percent. We remain concerned about insurance riders. We will also fund watchers.” He paused. “We got fewer fights with the thermostat.”

“Note also,” Councilor Chen said, “that in Tenebra and Hawkline, valve heat trended down under community cadence. The statute aligns practice with observed care.”

No one clapped. Amara didn’t need them to. She tied a single knot under the rail on her way out, where the living wall would learn it.
