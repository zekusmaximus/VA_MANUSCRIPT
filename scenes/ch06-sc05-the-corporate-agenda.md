The chamber narrowed to a single choice.
      "Dampeners escalating across districts," Jin warned. "Convergence wave in six."
      Amara anchored Serra’s fabric square to her interface. It woke, keyed to her field—threads humming with the quiet power of a thousand small buffers waiting at the edges.
      She braided three streams into one channel: the legacy handshake she’d coaxed awake; the stolen Helios baselines settling like a spine; the variance reservoirs—kids’ textiles, root‑net hubs, vent choruses—waiting to breathe when control tried to arrest them.
      "Injecting structured unpredictability," she said, and opened the gate. A countdown she didn’t start began in the corner of her HUD.
      The dampeners hit like cold. The fabric sang back warm. Across Marrow Quay and Tenebra Ward and Hawkline Annex, children’s shawls brightened under coats; root hubs held slack in soil; vent choruses fed breath into sensors that wanted stillness.
      "Channel holding," Nia whispered through grit. "I can keep the botanics alive if you keep the rhythm."
      "Keep it messy," Ravi said from the dark of his cut node. "That’s what they can’t freeze."
      Amara felt the load rise. Systems leaned into her. Drones converged. The fabric key drank variance and gave it back as music. At the threshold between control and collapse, she chose to keep breathing—and the city breathed with her.
