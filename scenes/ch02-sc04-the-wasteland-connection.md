The Hidden Garden's central meeting space had been carved from an old water storage tank, its curved walls now alive with flowing data displayed in bioluminescent patterns. Around a salvaged conference table sat an unlikely alliance: Verdant Network hackers in their glowing algae marks, Wasteland leaders with their practical, patch-worked tech, and Amara, still processing everything she'd seen.
      "The council isn't just allowing the corporate takeover," Ravi said, manipulating a holographic display above the table. "They're actively facilitating it." The display showed power flow data from multiple sectors, official and unofficial networks interweaving in complex patterns.
      "They're calling it 'system optimization,'" an elderly Wasteland woman said. Her name was Elena, and the respect others showed her was obvious. Her clothes might be salvaged, but the neural interface behind her ear was cutting-edge. "But look at the pattern."
      She gestured, and the hologram shifted to show Luminara's power grid over time. Official channels glowed blue, unofficial ones in green. Where they intersected, red points pulsed.
      "Those intersections," Amara leaned forward, recognition dawning. "They match the anomalies in Sector 7. But they're everywhere."
      "Each red point represents a community network they're trying to map," Kevin explained. "Underground gardens, independent power collectives, unofficial recycling centers "
      "Any place people have found their own solutions," Elena finished. "Any system they can't control."
      A younger Network member, Jin, their security specialist, pulled up another dataset. "Corporate drones aren't just mapping power usage. They're collecting data on everything: water recycling, food production, even social connections. Building a complete model of how communities survive outside official control."
      "To optimize it?" Amara asked, though she already knew the answer.
      "To eliminate it," Kevin said quietly. "You can't sell people solutions if they're solving their own problems."
      The implications hit Amara hard. She thought of the Hidden Garden's elegant chaos, of Maya's emerging algae hybrids, of all the innovations born from necessity and freedom. "The council must understand what they're destroying. Dr. Veltri "
      "Dr. Veltri visits the Wastelands," Elena interrupted. The room went silent. "Monthly inspections, very official. Very thorough."
      "What?" Amara's voice cracked slightly. "She never mentioned "
      "She documents everything," Jin said, bringing up new data. "Every unofficial network, every community innovation. We thought she was advocating for us, until "
      "Until we saw her reports to Solace," Ravi finished. "She's not protecting the networks. She's helping them understand how to replace them."
      The hologram shifted again, showing the council's proposed integration plan. What Amara had thought was a simple power grid upgrade revealed itself as something far more insidious. Phase one was mapping community networks. Phase two was replicating their functions under corporate control. Phase three was systematic replacement.
      "Tomorrow's vote isn't just about Luminara's official grid," Kevin said. "It's about every independent system, every community solution, every bit of freedom we've carved out of the waste they left us."
      Amara studied the data, her engineer's mind racing. "These community networks, they're not just about power distribution, are they? They're about human connection. About people finding ways to help each other survive."
      Elena nodded approvingly. "Now you're seeing it. The technical problem is just the surface. The real threat is to our independence. Our ability to adapt and grow on our own terms."
      "The council vote is tomorrow," Jin reminded them. "Even with this evidence "
      "Evidence isn't enough," Kevin said. "We need to show them what they're really voting on. Make them understand what's at stake."
      Amara's tablet lit up with a new alert. She pulled up the data, and her breath caught. "They're accelerating the timeline. The mapping drones, they're not just collecting data anymore. They're starting to actively interfere with unofficial networks."
      The room erupted in urgent conversation, different factions arguing approaches. Some wanted direct action, others advocated for political pressure. The divide between city and Wasteland perspectives threatened to derail the discussion.
      "Wait," Amara said, an idea forming. She manipulated the hologram, highlighting something everyone had missed. "Look at the pattern in the interference. They're not just mapping networks, they're testing responses. Learning how communities adapt."
      "Which means?" Elena asked, though her slight smile suggested she already knew.
      "Which means we can show them adaptation they won't expect." Amara's fingers flew over the controls, drawing connections between datasets. "The council thinks they're voting on an upgrade, on progress. We need to show them what real progress looks like."
      She looked up at the gathered alliance, hackers and survivors, engineers and activists, all working together despite their differences. "We need to show them this. Not just the technical threat, but what they're really trying to destroy. The power of connection itself."
      The meeting continued late into the night, plans forming and shifting like the bioluminescent patterns on the walls. But something had changed. The divide between city and Wasteland, between official and unofficial, between technical and human problems, was beginning to blur.
      Tomorrow's council vote wasn't just about power systems anymore. It was about the right to grow, to adapt, to connect on their own terms. And Amara was finally ready to take sides.
      The Garden's living networks pulsed around them, carrying messages of warning and hope through roots and circuits and human hearts. Tomorrow would test them all. But tonight, in this repurposed water tank deep in the Wastelands, something new was growing.
      Something even Solace's algorithms couldn't predict.
