The sun slid toward the margin and Luminara turned its face to meet it—heliotropic arrays swiveling like fields of glass sunflowers. From the Solspire's observation deck, Amara should have felt the city's usual evening calm. Instead the light felt off, like a chord held a beat too long. She watched the rays scatter across thousands of panels, a dazzling display that would have been pure joy if she hadn't known the numbers.
      Her tablet chimed, confirming what her body had already noticed. Sector 7 again—power output fluttering where it should have flowed. She traced the graph with a fingertip: clean terraces interrupted by burrs of variance. "Three percent," she murmured. "No weather, no scheduled maintenance..."
      The deck hummed with soft delight—tourists and locals taking pictures of a city that liked to show off its light. A young couple posed, their garments seeded with bioluminescent algae that glowed to their pulse. Veltri had helped bring that fashion from lab to street; the thought tugged a small smile from Amara before another alert dimmed it.
      "Ex—excuse me," a hesitant voice said. "Are you Amara Solis? The heliotrope arrays?"
      Amara turned. A very young intern—were they always this young?—clutched a datapad. Engineering Corps insignia, crisp and proud.
      "The arrays mostly designed themselves," she said, her standard deflection. "I just helped them grow in the right direction." The intern's eyes widened, catching the idea of panels that learned the sun like living things.
      "But the neural net integration—" he began.
      "—was a team effort." Amara's attention slid back to the tablet. The flutter had spread, still shy of the city's alert thresholds. She'd helped design those thresholds. That was why the pattern felt wrong.
      The intern lingered, hopeful. Amara gave him a kind nod and the slight turn that meant later. He retreated with a look that said he'd keep watching the arrays anyway. She was alone again, buoyed by a crowd.
      Below, Luminara unspooled like a living diagram. Vertical gardens combed the air and ate its harm. Turbines turned like patient birds between towers. Everywhere, arrays caught the last light and fed it into a mesh that had learned to share.
      The grid. She widened her view. Sector 7's irregularities were static against a well‑tuned song—small enough to miss unless you'd spent years listening for the wrong note.
      "Something's happening," she whispered, zooming. "Something's changing."
      A message flashed: Ravi from Central Control, requesting her presence. Unusual for this hour. She glanced at the sinking sun, its red glancing off the arrays. Years of tending the city's systems had taught her to trust how they felt in the bones. This wasn't random.
      Someone was teaching the city's heart to keep a different beat.
      The deck began to empty as the sun slipped out. Amara watched night take the city she'd helped grow. One by one, the lights came: pathway markers blooming bioluminescent, streetlamps sipping their own charge, windows glowing with algae power. A system designed to tend itself and the people in it.
      In Sector 7, some lights flickered in ways they shouldn't.
      Her tablet chimed again—Ravi, now marked urgent. Amara took a last look at the darkening horizon and turned toward the elevator. Work.
      The sun might be setting, but the work was only waking up.
