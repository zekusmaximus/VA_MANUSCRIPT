The sun dipped toward the horizon, casting a golden glow over the floating city of Luminara, but Amara Solis couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong with the light. From the observation deck of the Solspire, the city's tallest structure, she watched the evening rays scatter across thousands of solar arrays, creating a dazzling display that would have been beautiful if she hadn't known the numbers.
      Her tablet chimed softly, confirming her suspicions. Power output in Sector 7 fluctuated again, the graphs showing irregular spikes where there should have been smooth transitions. She traced the pattern with her finger, environmental engineering training kicking in automatically. "Three percent variance," she muttered. "No weather anomalies, no maintenance scheduled..."
      Around her, tourists and citizens filled the observation deck, taking photos of the sunset spectacle. A young couple posed against the railing, their clothes embedded with bioluminescent algae that pulsed in sync with their heartbeats, the latest fashion trend that Amara's old mentor, Dr. Veltri, had helped develop. The memory of Veltri's excitement about the technology brought a slight smile to Amara's face, quickly fading as another alert lit up her screen.
      "Ex-excuse me," a hesitant voice interrupted her thoughts. "Are you Amara Solis? The one who designed the heliotropic arrays?"
      Amara turned to find a young intern, they seemed to get younger every year, clutching a datapad. She recognized the Engineering Corps insignia on his sleeve.
      "The arrays mostly designed themselves," she replied, her standard deflection. "I just helped them grow in the right direction." The intern's eyes widened at her modest explanation of the bioengineered solar panels that could physically adapt to changing light conditions, like massive artificial sunflowers.
      "But the neural network integration," he began, enthusiasm overcoming his initial nervousness.
      "Was a team effort." Amara's attention drifted back to her tablet. The power fluctuations were spreading, subtle enough that the city's automated systems hadn't flagged them yet. She'd helped design those systems too, which was why she knew exactly how wrong this pattern was.
      The intern lingered, clearly hoping for more insight, but years of isolation had made Amara fluent in the language of gentle dismissal. A polite nod, a slight turn away, and soon she was alone again, surrounded by crowds.
      Below, Luminara spread out like a living dream. Vertical gardens cascaded down the sides of buildings, their vines engineered to capture pollutants and transform them into nutrients. Wind turbines spun lazily between the towers, their biomimetic designs based on bird wings and maple seeds. And everywhere, the solar arrays caught the dying light, feeding power into the city's complex grid.
      The grid. Amara pulled up a wider view on her tablet, expanding the power distribution map. The irregularities in Sector 7 were like a splash of static in an otherwise perfect symphony. Small enough to ignore, if you didn't know what to look for. But Amara had spent too many years watching these patterns, learning their rhythms, understanding their language.
      "Something's happening," she whispered to herself, zooming in on the affected area. "Something's changing."
      A message flashed across her screen, Ravi from Central Control requesting her presence. Unusual at this hour. She glanced once more at the setting sun, its light now turning the solar arrays blood-red. In all her years helping build Luminara's power systems, she'd learned to trust her instincts about their behavior. And right now, every instinct was screaming that these weren't just random fluctuations.
      Someone was tampering with her city's heart.
      The observation deck began to empty as the sun disappeared, tourists heading to dinner or evening entertainments. Amara stayed, watching darkness creep across the city she'd helped build. One by one, Luminara's lights came on: bioluminescent pathway markers, photovoltaic streetlamps, the soft glow of algae-powered windows. A perfect system, self-sustaining, beautiful.
      But in Sector 7, some of those lights were flickering in ways they shouldn't.
      Her tablet chimed again. Ravi's message was marked urgent now. Amara took one last look at the darkening horizon, then turned toward the elevator. She had work to do.
      The sun might be setting, but her day was far from over.
