Riya read the clause twice: *stability for optics.* The words were clean until someone had to breathe under them. Her screen reflected her face back at her—thirty-two years old, five years in S-SEC corridor management, good marks, clean record, the kind of mid-level operator who followed procedure because procedure was supposed to protect people. The clause didn't say *whose* stability. Didn't say *which* optics.

The monitoring station smelled like recycled air and the particular anxiety that came from watching numbers that represented bodies. Her coffee had gone cold an hour ago. She'd stopped drinking it when the heat alerts started climbing in Tenebra Pediatric—not red, not even orange, just that persistent yellow that meant children sleeping in rooms where the air was working too hard to pretend it was comfortable.

The corridor's clamp board showed green because green measured compliance with baseline parameters, not whether a six-year-old could sleep through the night without kicking off blankets that felt like they were fighting back. The ward's heat map showed a mosaic of yellows that translated to "not yet panic" in the system's vocabulary, which was different from the vocabulary nurses used when they called about restless kids and worried parents and whether maybe someone could adjust the evening buffer just a little, just enough.

Twenty seconds wouldn't fix anything structural. Wouldn't change policy. Wouldn't make her supervisor stop asking why her sector showed more variance than others, as if variance was the problem instead of what variance was trying to tell them.

But twenty seconds might let a compressor exhale. Might give a valve permission to remember it knew how to regulate without being forced.

She opened a micro‑window—twenty seconds—against procedure, inside the gray the policy left for discretion and blame. Her hands were steadier than she expected. Her heart was not. The authorization code asked for a reason. She typed: *Preventive adjustment, thermal drift monitoring.* The words meant nothing. The words were camouflage for *because children shouldn't have to earn the right to sleep cool.*

"Log it temporary; monitor," she said to no one, then to the record, and her voice sounded calm, professional, exactly the tone that procedure required. Her hand hovered over the cancel command—two seconds to undo it, to pretend she hadn't just chosen listening over optics, breath over baseline. She did not cancel.

Through the monitor, she watched the corridor's atmospheric readings shift. Not dramatically. Not enough to trigger alerts. Just enough to stop fighting itself for twenty seconds, just enough to let the system remember it had been designed by people who understood that living things need room to adjust.

A janitor on the mezzanine—older woman, gray braid, Riya had seen her working third shift for months but never learned her name—tied a small knot in a piece of string and set the ledger under the rail. Just that. No announcement. No ceremony. The building's compressor cooled a fraction. Point-two degrees. Barely measurable.

The fight she would have later would be about that fraction. Would be about discretion versus deviation. Would be about whether she'd followed the *spirit* of stability protocol or violated the letter. Whether she'd protected the corridor or undermined the system's authority to define what protection meant.

She saved the log. Marked it for review. Waited for the callback that would come, inevitably, asking her to explain her choices to people who'd never had to watch heat maps of children's wards at 2 a.m. and decide whether procedure was protection or just another kind of pressure.

Her hands were shaking now. She hadn't noticed when they'd started.
