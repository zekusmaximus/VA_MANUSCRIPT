The entrance to Kevin's settlement wore a junkyard's face. Broken panels leaned against rusted containers, dust-soft and convincing. Amara followed him through the maze, her engineer's eye tugged by the tells: a crack angled too precisely, a gap where airflow and foot traffic had been planned.
      "Designed to read abandoned," Kevin said. "Drones classify and move on." He laid a hand to a container wall. A hidden sensor answered with soft bioluminescence. "Life routes around the classification."
      The container's side parted without a sound. A vertical shaft descended into dark; green pulsed along the walls in an unsettlingly familiar cadence.
      "That's my reactor's neural signature," Amara breathed. "We never built them this small, this efficient."
      Kevin's smile held a hint of pride. "We learned from your design. Made it our own." 
      The shaft opened into a vast underground chamber, but 'chamber' was too lifeless a word for the space before her. It was an inverted forest of light and life.
      Hydroponic columns spiraled floor to ceiling, maximizing growth while sipping water. Plants grew in improbable geometries, roots exposed in transparent pods that doubled as biological processors. Each pod pulsed with algae kin to Luminara's—but learning new tricks.
      "The algae isn't just light," Kevin said, touching a pod. "It reads root impulses, learns, adapts nutrient flow in real time." He glanced at her. "Sound familiar?"
      "A botanical neural network," Amara said. "We theorized it. The power requirements—" She trailed off, watching light and life do the math for her.
      "Ah, yes. Power." Kevin led her deeper into the garden. "That's where your reactor design really shines. Though we made some... modifications."
      At the chamber's heart a crystal lattice cradled a miniaturized reactor core. Her version had favored rigid control; this one thrived on guided wildness. Tendrils of bioluminescence wrapped salvaged cells, patterns shifting like living circuitry.
      "It's beautiful," she whispered, professional distance dissolving. "But how? The original needed massive cooling, constant maintenance—"
      "Look closer," Kevin suggested. "At the integration points."
      Amara stepped closer. The algae didn't just power; it maintained. Each tendril conducted and repaired, replacing circuits with living connections that could heal.
      "We couldn't match your precision," Kevin said, "so we let the system evolve solutions. The algae learned to work with what we had. So did we."
      Around them, the garden hummed. Children tended columns under elders' eyes. Engineers Amara's age maintained the core with salvaged‑looking tools that worked like instruments. Surfaces did double and triple duty: catching water, making power, carrying data.
      "Your corporate assessment called us 'primitive,'" Kevin noted, watching her take it all in. "Said we lacked the expertise to maintain advanced systems." There was no bitterness in his voice, only a quiet pride. "We let them believe that. It's safer when they underestimate us."
      Amara's hand went to her tablet, then stopped. Documenting felt insufficient. This was not just technique; it was resilience made visible, community knowledge in motion.
      "The algae," she said. "Not just adapted from ours—you bred in local variants. That's why it handles multiple inputs."
      Kevin nodded. "Your science gave it structure. Necessity gave it flexibility." He touched a glowing tendril. "Sometimes the best solution is to stop fixing the answer in advance."
      A young girl approached them, carrying a transparent pod containing a new algae culture. The colors in this one were slightly different, the patterns more complex.
      "Third generation hybrid," the girl reported proudly. "Better power efficiency, and it's learning faster than the others."
      Kevin introduced her as Maya, one of their youngest botanists. The girl's eyes widened when she realized who Amara was.
      "You're the one who wrote the original algorithms!" Maya exclaimed. "We used your papers to understand the base patterns. But look," She held up her pod. "We added something new. Want to see?"
      Before Amara could respond, an alert pulsed through the garden's living networks. The light patterns shifted, information flowing through algae and roots and salvaged circuits.
      "Corporate drone sweep," Kevin said grimly. "Right on schedule." He turned to Maya. "Show her the rest later. For now "
      "For now," Amara interrupted, "I need to understand exactly how you've modified my reactor design." She met his surprised look with determination. "The council votes on Solace's proposal tomorrow. They need to see what they're really trying to destroy."
      Light pulsed around them, each circuit and culture carrying a story of survival and repair. In the Garden's heart, Amara began to understand what power looked like when it stayed alive.
      Not control. Connection.
