Jin pushed the failed node to the edge of the table the way you move a thing you respected. "It bought us the window," he said. "We log that clearly."

Ravi annotated the heartbeat timing they had extracted from Helios. "Land seed on the exhale," he murmured, not for poetry, but because the numbers insisted. He circled tolerances:

- Drift ±0.3 s acceptable under corridor cadence
- Widen to five-beat at altitude per Kaito's note
- Safe buffer draw 0.5–1.0 C into cloth per ten meters of rail

"We'll lose another if we chase smooth lines," Jin said. "Teach the memory instead." He underlined it twice, then added the only line that made them both pause: COST: ONE NODE.

Baseline Capture Summary (Helios dampener window)
- Source: Helios dampener exhale alignment with S7-HELIOTROPIC.SEED
- Nominal window: 3.0 s listen / 2.0 s release (corridor)
- Altitude variant: five-beat listen pattern (High Garden)
- Drift tolerance: ±0.3 s (below 18 C widen by up to 0.3 s)
- Ghost ceiling: ≤ 60 s per hour
- Buffer draw: 0.5–1.0 C per 10 m rail (return to cloth on off-beat)
- Failure accounting: log COST: ONE NODE if a noncritical node burns to preserve breath

Before/After Snapshots (representative)
- Brightline corridor: compressor load −0.2% during window; complaints −32% over window hour; drift inside tolerance
- Tenebra pediatric cove: valve heat −0.1 C; nurse noted infant sleep improved during window
- Arc-9 stair core: stable at 97 (arb. units); ALL'S WELL knot tied at close

Risk Cases and Guardrails
Case A — Cold Rails (ambient < 18 C)
- Symptom: rails read cold; buffer draw insufficient at standard window
- Action: widen cadence by up to +0.3 s; move contact to roots on listen; return heat to cloth on release
- Metrics: maintain draw within 0.5–1.0 C/10 m; keep drift within widened tolerance; log human notes (cold hands, breath ease)

Case B — Altitude Storms (High Garden)
- Symptom: gust timing destabilizes 3/2 cadence; altitude air carries longer memory
- Action: adopt five-beat window; maintain rope/thread safety; prioritize roots if rails spike cold
- Metrics: hold five-beat through gust; confirm via tags; debrief ledger with Kaito's notes

Case C — Clamp Interference (closet clamp/portable units)
- Symptom: displays trend to "perfect"; room feels wrong; breath flattens
- Action: disable clamp; post CLOSET CLAMP tag; re-establish window; teach staff to feel wrongness
- Metrics: complaint volume falls; compressor load relaxes; knot code at close

Case D — Node Sacrifice Pressure
- Symptom: repeated spikes threaten critical care
- Action: allow burn of one noncritical node under watch; log COST: ONE NODE; open micro-window for recovery
- Metrics: correlate burn with stabilized care; attach note for replacement/relay request

Decision Flow (field)
1) Listen at rail: confirm 3/2 cadence (or five-beat altitude)
2) Check ambient; set drift tolerance (±0.3 s; widen if < 18 C)
3) Measure draw: target 0.5–1.0 C/10 m; adjust contact (roots vs. shawl)
4) Verify ghost ceiling ≤ 60 s/hr; stagger rotations ≤ 15 min
5) If clamp present and room feels wrong: disable; tag CLOSET CLAMP
6) If noncritical node must burn to preserve breath: proceed; log; tie knot
7) Close window: log compressor/valve/complaints; send ALL'S WELL

Rationale Notes
- Drift ±0.3 s preserves human-friendly counting without driving error alarms; widening under cold maintains stability without chasing smooth lines
- Buffer draw target balances tactile comfort (no sting) with meaningful transfer; cloth/rail/roots switching preserves learning by using different reservoirs
- Ghost ceiling respects safety while acknowledging that temporary invisibility can be humane when systems punish listening

Exhibit A — Timing Overlay
- New Singapore light-dream pause aligns with Helios exhale; S7 capture confirms landing window
- Ops annotation: HEARTBEAT: LAND SEED ON EXHALE (distributed to seed-run and corridor crews)

Exhibit B — Telemetry Table (abridged)
| Site | Metric | Pre | Window | Post |
| Brightline Corridor | Complaints | baseline | −32% | −18% |
| Brightline Corridor | Compressor load | baseline | −0.2% | −0.1% |
| Tenebra Pediatric | Valve heat | baseline | −0.1 C | steady |
| Arc-9 Stair | Tags (arb.) | 96 | 97 | 97 |

Follow-ups
- Replace burned noncritical node; request relay budget; document learning preserved
- Update v0.9 template to v1.0 with field examples and caution notes
- Share clamp-interference drill with Brightline/housekeeping teams

Jin rested his palm on the failed node’s casing. "We didn’t waste this," he said. "We made it into a lesson." Ravi nodded and under the line that already mattered, he wrote one more: LESSON: MERCY COUNTS.
