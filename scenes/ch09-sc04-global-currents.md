Veltri watched two feeds: a corridor with a single cloth knot under a rail, and a control panel waiting for her to choose between clamp and allow.
      The line held—not flat but true. She bookmarked a frame where the window opened and nothing bad happened, then tapped “temporary allow” on a noncritical clamp half a district away and wrote a note no one would read: monitor; windows are not faults.
      She closed both feeds before the part of her that still loved perfect charts could argue.

She made tea with the same deliberate motions she used to calibrate optics. Boil. Steep. Count to one hundred and twenty without glancing at a display. When she returned to the console, the afterimage of the knot on the rail was still on her retina. She had tied that knot once, years ago, under a bench where no one could see it, just to see if her hands remembered how to mean something without data.

On a side window she opened her half-finished bench note: Variance amplifier, advisory only, no keys. She added one more line to the top: respect heartbeat; widen by half a second where mercy proves itself. The language made her jaw clench. Not precise enough. But the corridor did not care about her jaw. It cared about breath.

“Temporary allow extended,” she told the log, keeping her voice level. “No adverse events. Complaints down. Compressor draw eased.” She did not write that the concierge had stopped frowning or that the child on the bench had fallen asleep. Those were not metrics. They were the reasons metrics mattered.

Her finger hovered over the clamp control for the next district. She did not press it. Instead, she opened the watcher’s feed and watched a janitor teach a teenager to tie ALL’S WELL without looking. “Once more,” the janitor said, patient as old trees.

Veltri closed the feed again, not because it hurt but because it did not, and that surprised her. Somewhere between bench and boardroom she had begun to believe that only arguments counted. Watching care happen without her did not feel like defeat. It felt like data.

She typed two words into a private draft no one would see until after Chapter Ten: stand down.
