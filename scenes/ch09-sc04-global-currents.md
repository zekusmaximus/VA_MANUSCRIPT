Veltri watched two feeds at once: a clinic corridor with a single cloth knot under a rail, and a control panel waiting for her to choose between clamp and allow.
      The corridor’s line held, not flat but true. A concierge moved through like someone who had learned to listen with their hands.
      She bookmarked a frame where the window opened and nothing bad happened. In the other feed she tapped “temporary allow” on a noncritical clamp half a district away and wrote a note no one would read: monitor; windows are not faults.
      She closed both feeds before the part of her that still loved perfect charts could argue.
