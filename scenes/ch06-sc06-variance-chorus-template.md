They spread the template on a table that had once been a water tank—Elena’s hands steady over light that carried more history than circuits had a right to.

“No specialists,” Nia said, pencil tapping the margin like a metronome. “If the botanics go thin at night, they can do this with who they have.”

“Kids,” Elena said. “Janitors. Concierges. Elders.” The list made a cadence of its own.

Variance Chorus — Community Protocol (v0.9)

Inputs:

- People: 3–5 bodies; any ages; one timekeeper. 
- Materials: 2–3 conductive shawls; saltwater; old cotton towels; cloth tags/string for knot code.
- Places: at a root surfaced basin, under a rail near vents, or beside a planter with visible bio‑layer.

Guardrails:

- No heroics: buffers, not martyrs. Leader sits if wounded.
- Salt scrub hands/forearms; dry with cotton; no synthetic residue.
- Rotation max 15 minutes; swap out if dizzy; stop if pain spikes.
- One noncritical node may be sacrificed if required; note it.
- Ghost windows limited (≤ 60s per hour) to avoid pattern learning.
- Watchers’ knot code active; log in ledger; add time and note.

Cadence:

1) Timekeeper counts three‑on, two‑off—human pulse set by the calmest present.
2) Palms to root (or hand to rail) in sequence A‑B‑C; shawl warms on contact; buffer points to cloth during ‘on,’ returns to roots during ‘off.’
3) After one full rotation, pause; timekeeper calls “breathe”; swap positions.
4) Repeat three rotations; check air and compressor logs; tie one knot if all’s well, two if heat, three if water.

Fallbacks:

- If clamps bite mid‑rotation: hold cadence; add one more body to the count; widen the breath on ‘off.’
- If sensors misclassify: hide a metronome in housekeeping for ≤ 60s; never extend.
- If watchers spot drift: stop and switch to manual override; call nearest garden tech.

“They won’t need to know why it works,” Elena said. “Just how to hold the breath until the system remembers.”

Nia added a last line to the card before they photographed it into ten ledgers and a hundred pockets: Windows are not faults. Listening is not error. Leader sits if wounded.

“Send it,” she told Jin. “Mark it FRAGILE and KIND.”
