The city ran at night. Amara did too. She took the back stairs down from the Solspire and let her feet find the old service routes where the deck plates still sang. No crowds here, just the pulse of pumps and the wind scraping past rails. Movement sanded down the edges of what Veltri had shown her.
      Beneath a maintenance lamp she pulled the simulation back up, thumbs flicking through overlays until the gray washed the map again: ACCEPTABLE VARIANCE. The words were clinical. The effect was not. Marrow Quay. Tenebra Ward. Hawkline Annex. Places she knew. Vendors who kept her fed on double shifts. A clinic that patched a tech after a scaffold fall. People.
      She overlaid her own baselines. The thresholds she had written years ago dutifully dimmed the same blocks, the same names.
      Her design made those places invisible.
      She killed the overlay and breathed through the sudden quiet. Then she typed, fingers steady despite adrenaline: a ping to the Verdant Network—bare coordinates, a time before dawn, and proof she would bring.
      A gust rattled the lamp cage. Somewhere far off, a line of streetlights brightened together and fell apart again.
      Practice, not failure.
      She started running again.
