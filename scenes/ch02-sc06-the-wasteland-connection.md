The drones came at sunset; Amara saw them first as code. Her tablet traced scanning patterns—complex, adaptive—and her stomach dropped. "These aren't standard protocols," she whispered from behind Serra's fabric. "The base architecture—I helped design it."
      She remembered late nights in Veltri's lab, building networks that learned. "The system needs to breathe," Veltri had said. "Like a living thing." Now those principles hunted for unauthorized life.
      "Multi‑spectrum," she told Kevin as sleek forms cut the gold. "Thermal, power signatures, even bioelectric fields—exactly the patterns we saw in the Garden."
      "Good thing we have patterns of our own." Kevin touched the fabric. Neural threads answered: heat bled into microchannels, power signatures scattered and reformed, their bioelectric fields masked by adaptive resonance.
      "Not just camouflage," she said. "It's distributed processing. Like the Garden, but woven into—"
      "—everything we wear and build," Kevin said, pride quiet. "Serra's weave merged with your reactor principles. Adaptation in the thread."
      The nearest drone paused overhead, sensors pulsing in familiar rhythms. Amara held her breath, recognizing her own perfected search protocols. The fabric rippled, matching scans that kept learning.
      "They're learning," she breathed. "Evolving with each sweep."
      "So are we." Kevin found a thread. Energy pulsed through the weave—and Amara felt the link: Garden networks connecting to Serra's processors, communities sharing adaptations in real time. The fabric steadied, patterns shifting to meet each scan.
      Her tablet chirped. Ravi: Council chamber being prepared. Corporate monitors installed. Veltri presenting vote framework—three phases starting with "voluntary" standardization. They're starting without approval.
      "We need to move," Kevin said, reading the shift in her expression. "Transport's waiting, but timing will be critical. The drones have cut off most escape vectors."
      They moved across the upper levels, a dance between concealment and detection. Below, the evening's shared light had gone dark—communities hiding their connections. Anger found her where theory never reached.
      Serra emerged from the shadows as they reached the platform, carrying something that seemed to pulse with its own inner light. "For the council," she said, pressing it into Amara's hands. "And for you."
      The package held a square of unlike fabric. When she touched it, her interface flooded—not data alone, but experience. Settlement history written in light and power and adaptation. Communities learning, growing, connecting in ways efficiency models couldn't hold.
      "Coded to your bioelectric pattern," Serra said. "Linked to Garden and textile networks. Show them what optimization looks like when it's alive."
      "The council has already started implementing changes," Amara warned. "Veltri is moving faster than we expected."
      "Then we'll adapt faster." Serra's smile was fierce. "That's what living systems do."
      Proximity alert: drones. They boarded fast; the platform warmed in silence. Rising, Amara held the fabric and felt it resonate with her own field—distant communities pulsing through it, each a note in a survival chorus.
      "Vote is phased," she said, scanning Ravi's data. "Voluntary standardization, then mandatory integration, then full oversight. 'Systematic optimization of community resources.'"
      "Systematic elimination, you mean." Kevin's voice was grim. "How many council members support it?"
      "Seven already committed. Four opposed. Two undecided." Amara's fingers traced patterns in the fabric, drawing strength from its stored wisdom. "We'll need to convince at least "
      The platform lurched. A drone burned through their cover. Red warnings flared as others converged.
      "Hold on," Kevin said, his hands moving across the controls. The platform dropped, energy dampers screaming. They plunged through layers of warm air, the fabric around them working desperately to mask their signature.
      Amara's neural interface flashed with sudden insight. "The Garden's network," she said. "If we can link it with Serra's fabric at a larger scale..."
      She didn't need to finish. Kevin was already bridging systems. She wove Garden protocols into textile processors. Power surged through microthreads, casting false signatures. Drones scattered after ghosts.
      "They'll adapt to that," Kevin warned as they stabilized.
      "Good." Amara smiled, feeling the combined strength of Garden and fabric networks humming through her interface. "So will we."
      They rose again, cloaked in their own shadows. Her tablet lit: Ravi—corporate security in chamber. Veltri authorized access to all systems for "evaluation." Time short.
      "Having second thoughts?" Kevin asked quietly.
      Amara looked back at the darkened settlements—Garden circuits, Serra's textiles, a thousand necessary innovations. Then she thought of Veltri and the vision they'd once shared: technology that breathes and grows.
      "No," she said. "For the first time, I know exactly what we're fighting for."
      She touched the fabric one last time. Stored knowledge pulsed in time with her resolve. Tomorrow would test everything—technology, courage, faith in growth that isn't controlled. Tomorrow she'd face her mentor with a different proof of progress.
      Tomorrow would decide: optimized or allowed to evolve.
      The choice was clear.
