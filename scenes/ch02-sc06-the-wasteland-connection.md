      The drones came at sunset, but Amara saw them first in code. Her tablet displayed their scanning patterns, complex, adaptive algorithms that made her heart sink. "These aren't standard corporate protocols," she whispered from behind Serra's solar fabric. "The base architecture... I helped design it."
      She remembered late nights in Veltri's lab, developing neural networks that could learn and grow. "The system needs to breathe," Veltri had said then, her eyes bright with possibility. "Like a living thing." Now those same principles had been twisted into something predatory, hunting for signs of unauthorized life.
      "They're using multi-spectrum analysis," she told Kevin, watching the drones' sleek forms cut through golden light. "Thermal imaging, power signatures, even bioelectric fields. Looking for exactly the kind of patterns we saw in the Hidden Garden."
      "Good thing we've got patterns of our own." Kevin touched the fabric sheltering them, and Amara watched in fascination as its neural threads responded. Temperature differentials dispersed through microscopic channels. Power signatures scattered and reformed in randomized bursts. Even their bioelectric fields were masked by the fabric's adaptive resonance.
      "It's not just camouflage," she realized. "The whole thing's a distributed processing network. Like the Garden's systems, but woven into "
      "Everything we wear, everything we build." Kevin's voice carried quiet pride. "Serra's work merged with your reactor principles. Adaptation at the molecular level."
      The nearest drone paused overhead, its sensors pulsing with familiar rhythms. Amara held her breath, recognizing the search protocols she'd helped perfect. For a moment, the fabric around them rippled, struggling to match the drone's increasingly sophisticated scans.
      "They're learning," she breathed. "The algorithms are evolving with each sweep."
      "So are we." Kevin's hand found a particular thread in the fabric. A pulse of energy traveled through the weave, and suddenly Amara felt it, the Hidden Garden's neural networks connecting with Serra's textile processors, communities sharing adaptations in real time. The fabric stabilized, its patterns shifting to meet each new scan.
      Her tablet chirped: an incoming message from Ravi. Her stomach tightened as she read: Council chamber being prepared. Corporate reps installing proprietary monitoring systems. Veltri presented preliminary vote framework: three phases, starting with "voluntary" standardization. They're not waiting for approval to begin.
      "We need to move," Kevin said, reading the shift in her expression. "Transport's waiting, but timing will be critical. The drones have cut off most escape vectors."
      They made their way across the settlement's upper levels, each step a dangerous dance between concealment and detection. Below, the evening light show that had so moved Amara earlier was now completely dark. Communities going silent, hiding their connections. The sight made her angry in a way theory never had.
      Serra emerged from the shadows as they reached the platform, carrying something that seemed to pulse with its own inner light. "For the council," she said, pressing it into Amara's hands. "And for you."
      The package contained a square of fabric unlike any Amara had seen. As she touched it, information flooded her neural interface, not just data, but experience. The history of the settlement written in light and power and adaptation. She saw communities learning, growing, connecting in ways corporate efficiency models could never capture.
      "It's coded to your specific bioelectric pattern," Serra explained. "And linked to both Garden and textile networks. Show them what real optimization looks like, not just the numbers, but the life behind them."
      "The council has already started implementing changes," Amara warned. "Veltri is moving faster than we expected."
      "Then we'll adapt faster." Serra's smile was fierce. "That's what living systems do."
      A proximity alert pulsed through their comms: drone sweep approaching. They boarded quickly, the platform's systems warming in perfect silence. As they rose, Amara clutched the fabric, feeling its resonance with her own energy patterns grow stronger. Through it, she could sense the pulse of distant communities, each one a unique note in a symphony of survival.
      "Tomorrow's vote is structured in phases," she said, studying Ravi's data. "Voluntary standardization first, then mandatory integration, finally full corporate oversight. They're calling it 'systematic optimization of community resources.'"
      "Systematic elimination, you mean." Kevin's voice was grim. "How many council members support it?"
      "Seven already committed. Four opposed. Two undecided." Amara's fingers traced patterns in the fabric, drawing strength from its stored wisdom. "We'll need to convince at least "
      The platform lurched. A drone had spotted them, its sensors burning through their cover. Red warning lights flashed across Amara's tablet as more drones converged.
      "Hold on," Kevin said, his hands moving across the controls. The platform dropped, energy dampers screaming. They plunged through layers of warm air, the fabric around them working desperately to mask their signature.
      Amara's neural interface flashed with sudden insight. "The Garden's network," she said. "If we can link it with Serra's fabric at a larger scale..."
      She didn't need to finish. Kevin was already connecting systems, letting her weave Garden protocols into textile processors. Power surged through microscopic threads, creating a cascade of false signatures. The drones scattered, chasing phantom signals.
      "They'll adapt to that trick," Kevin warned as they stabilized.
      "Good." Amara smiled, feeling the combined strength of Garden and fabric networks humming through her interface. "So will we."
      They rose again, cloaked in shadows of their own making. Her tablet lit up with another message from Ravi: Corporate security installed in chamber. Veltri authorized access to all city systems for "evaluation." Time running out.
      "Having second thoughts?" Kevin asked quietly.
      Amara looked back at the darkened settlements, remembering everything they'd shown her. The Hidden Garden's living circuits. Serra's adaptive textiles. Countless innovations born from necessity and freedom. Then she thought of Veltri, of the vision they'd once shared of technology that could breathe and grow.
      "No," she said. "For the first time, I know exactly what we're fighting for."
      She touched the fabric one last time, feeling its stored knowledge pulse in harmony with her own determination. Tomorrow would test everything, their technology, their courage, their faith in the power of uncontrolled growth. Tomorrow she would face her mentor across the council chamber, armed with evidence of a different kind of progress.
      Tomorrow would decide whether the future would be optimized or allowed to evolve.
      The choice, finally, was clear.
