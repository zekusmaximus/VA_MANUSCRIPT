The monitoring center hummed with a different tension now. Before, they tracked influence; now they watched it strike. On the main display, community networks flickered like stars going dark.
      "Another cluster gone in Sector 4," Nia reported, her hands moving through streams of botanical data. "They're targeting the independent food gardens first. Cutting off their power and water access."
      Amara studied the patterns, remembering the Memory Garden's warnings. "They're not just disabling the networks," she said. "They're documenting how communities respond to the loss. Learning from our adaptations."
      "Like watching an organism under controlled shock," Ravi said, voice tight as he tracked fluctuations. "Veltri's approach is… thorough."
      The name still hurt, but Amara forced herself to focus on the data. Her mentor's digital signature was unmistakable in the corporate protocols, elegant, precise, and utterly ruthless in their efficiency.
      "New activity," Jin called from his security station. "Dr. Veltri just accessed the old research archives. She's pulling data on early neural network experiments."
      Amara moved to his station, recognition hitting hard. "Those are my old files. Our early work on letting systems evolve naturally." The interface showed Veltri methodically copying years of research data. "She's not just looking at the technical specs. She's studying our whole approach to adaptive growth."
      "To prevent it?" Kevin asked quietly.
      "To simulate it," Amara said, tracing data. "A perfect model of adaptation—looks like evolution, follows preset paths."
      "Speaking of paths," Elena interrupted, "look at this." She shifted the main display to show Luminara's central districts. Corporate drones moved in strict geometric patterns, their scanning protocols more aggressive than before. She slid a recovered cam‑wafer into a reader that grew from the wall. For eight seconds, they watched a sped‑up sweep over Tenebra Ward: grids snapping shut, then failing as textiles rippled and rerouted load. Proof, not theory.
      "Not just mapping," Amara said. "Establishing control zones—staging for full implementation after the vote."
      A sudden alert pulled their attention to Sector 7. Lantern House—the same shelter they’d saved—flickered hard, then dropped as dampeners bit in.
      "Response time?" Jin demanded.
      "Three minutes," Ravi reported, watching the community's reactions. "They rerouted power through three separate backup systems. Each one using a different technical approach."
      Amara smiled despite the tension. "Just like we planned. Show them adaptation they can't predict."
      Drones noticed too, shifting scans to map new flows. Communities kept changing configurations—each solution seeding the next. Asha’s voice cracked over comms—"med warmers holding"—and Amara felt her jaw set.
      "It's working," Kevin said, watching the patterns shift. "They can't map what won't hold still."
      "Dr. Veltri is responding," Jin warned. The display showed her digital signature moving through city systems, deploying new monitoring and dampener protocols. "She's trying to establish baseline patterns, find the underlying logic—and freeze it."
      "She always did love finding order in chaos," Amara murmured. The words tasted bitter. On a secondary screen, she could see her mentor in her lab, surrounded by holographic displays of community network data. The same intense focus Amara had once admired now felt threatening.
      "New corporate deployment," Elena reported. "They're moving systematic disruption protocols into position around all major community nodes."
      To Amara, the display painted a clear picture: corporate forces preparing for full implementation, positioning themselves to take control the moment the council vote passed. Dr. Veltri's influence was visible in every elegant strategy, every precise calculation.
      "She's not just helping them," Amara said softly. "She's improving their approach. Making it more..." She struggled with the word.
      "Efficient," Kevin finished. His hand found hers, warm against the cool light of the displays.
      "Look at these gradients," Ravi said, pulling new streams. "Not just cutoffs—dependency patterns. Teaching communities to lean on corporate systems without noticing."
      "Classic Veltri," Amara nodded. "She always said the best way to help a system grow was to make it need you."
      The words triggered a memory: long nights in the lab, watching neural networks evolve, her mentor's voice full of passion about the perfect balance between support and freedom. When had that balance shifted? When had support become control?
      A new alert cut through her reflection. The corporate drones were changing formation, establishing a pattern she recognized from the Memory Garden's records.
      "They're starting convergence protocols," she announced. "Just like in New Alexandria. Systematic isolation in hours if we don't accelerate."
      "Before the council vote?" Jin looked up sharply. "That's not the pattern."
      "No," Amara agreed, watching her mentor's digital signature move through the city's systems. "She's adapting too. Learning from our resistance."
      The displays told a clear story: corporate forces advancing, community networks adapting, an intricate dance of control and defiance. And through it all, Dr. Veltri's influence grew more visible, more precise, more absolute.
      "How long?" Elena asked.
      Amara calculated quickly. "At this rate? Critical coverage in under six hours. Once they lock full mapping..."
      "They won't need the council's approval," Kevin finished. "They'll have effective control already."
      Amara felt the room absorb this, their carefully gathered data painting an increasingly urgent picture. Then she noticed something in the Hidden Garden's response patterns, a subtle shift in how the communities were connecting.
      "Look at this," she said, highlighting the changes. "They're not just adapting individually anymore. They're learning from each other. Sharing solutions in real time."
      Ravi leaned in. "The network evolution rate is accelerating. Each adaptation spawns three more."
      "Just like a living system," Nia added, natural pride in her voice.
      "But is it happening fast enough?" Jin asked the question they were all thinking.
      Amara studied the patterns, seeing both threat and hope in the flowing data. "It has to be," she said. "Because if it isn't..."
      She didn't need to finish. They all knew what failure looked like. The Memory Garden held too many records of lost cities, broken communities, controlled growth.
      "Drone formations tightening," Elena reported. "Final mapping sweep starting. Helios demo permit window opens in three hours." Ravi layered the agenda. "We flag the heist at showtime: baselines, then proof rolled into the chamber." 
      Amara watched the patterns—corporate efficiency meeting community creativity. Tomorrow's vote felt distant. The real battle had already begun.
      The true test wasn't just whether they could resist control.
      It was whether they could grow faster than the forces trying to contain them.
      Above them, Luminara's lights flickered as power shifted between official and unofficial networks, between corporate control and community adaptation, between imposed order and organic growth.
      Between what was and what could be.
      The next few hours would decide which future would take root.
