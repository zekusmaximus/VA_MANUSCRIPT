      The Network's monitoring center hummed with a different kind of tension now. Where before they'd tracked patterns of corporate influence, now they watched it strike. On the main display, community networks flickered like stars going dark.
      "Another cluster gone in Sector 4," Nia reported, her hands moving through streams of botanical data. "They're targeting the independent food gardens first. Cutting off their power and water access."
      Amara studied the patterns, remembering the Memory Garden's warnings. "They're not just disabling the networks," she said. "They're documenting how communities respond to the loss. Learning from our adaptations."
      "Like watching how an organism reacts to systematic shock." Ravi's voice was tight as he tracked power fluctuations. "Dr. Veltri's approach is... thorough."
      The name still hurt, but Amara forced herself to focus on the data. Her mentor's digital signature was unmistakable in the corporate protocols, elegant, precise, and utterly ruthless in their efficiency.
      "New activity," Jin called from his security station. "Dr. Veltri just accessed the old research archives. She's pulling data on early neural network experiments."
      Amara moved to his station, recognition hitting hard. "Those are my old files. Our early work on letting systems evolve naturally." The interface showed Veltri methodically copying years of research data. "She's not just looking at the technical specs. She's studying our whole approach to adaptive growth."
      "To prevent it?" Kevin asked quietly.
      "To simulate it." Amara's fingers traced patterns in the data flow. "She's building a perfect model of natural adaptation. Something that looks like evolution but follows predetermined paths."
      "Speaking of paths," Elena interrupted, "look at this." She shifted the main display to show Luminara's central districts. Corporate drones moved in strict geometric patterns, their scanning protocols more aggressive than before.
      "They're not just mapping anymore," Amara realized. "They're establishing control zones. Getting ready for full implementation after the council vote."
      A sudden alert pulled their attention to Sector 7. One of the Hidden Garden's auxiliary networks had gone dark, cutting off power to a community shelter.
      "Response time?" Jin demanded.
      "Three minutes," Ravi reported, watching the community's reactions. "They rerouted power through three separate backup systems. Each one using a different technical approach."
      Amara smiled despite the tension. "Just like we planned. Show them adaptation they can't predict."
      The corporate drones had noticed too. Their scanning patterns shifted, trying to map the new power flows. But the community kept changing configurations, each solution more creative than the last.
      "It's working," Kevin said, watching the patterns shift. "They can't map what won't hold still."
      "Dr. Veltri is responding," Jin warned. The display showed her digital signature moving through city systems, deploying new monitoring protocols. "She's trying to establish baseline patterns, find the underlying logic."
      "She always did love finding order in chaos," Amara murmured. The words tasted bitter. On a secondary screen, she could see her mentor in her lab, surrounded by holographic displays of community network data. The same intense focus Amara had once admired now felt threatening.
      "New corporate deployment," Elena reported. "They're moving systematic disruption protocols into position around all major community nodes."
      The display painted a clear picture: corporate forces preparing for full implementation, positioning themselves to take control the moment the council vote passed. Dr. Veltri's influence was visible in every elegant strategy, every precise calculation.
      "She's not just helping them," Amara said softly. "She's improving their approach. Making it more..." She struggled with the word.
      "Efficient," Kevin finished. His hand found hers, warm against the cool light of the displays.
      "Look at these power gradients," Ravi called up new data streams. "They're not just cutting off independent networks. They're creating dependency patterns. Making communities rely on corporate systems without realizing it."
      "Classic Veltri," Amara nodded. "She always said the best way to help a system grow was to make it need you."
      The words triggered a memory: long nights in the lab, watching neural networks evolve, her mentor's voice full of passion about the perfect balance between support and freedom. When had that balance shifted? When had support become control?
      A new alert cut through her reflection. The corporate drones were changing formation, establishing a pattern she recognized from the Memory Garden's records.
      "They're starting convergence protocols," she announced. "Just like in New Alexandria. They'll begin systematic network isolation within hours."
      "Before the council vote?" Jin looked up sharply. "That's not the pattern."
      "No," Amara agreed, watching her mentor's digital signature move through the city's systems. "She's adapting too. Learning from our resistance."
      The displays told a clear story: corporate forces advancing, community networks adapting, an intricate dance of control and defiance. And through it all, Dr. Veltri's influence grew more visible, more precise, more absolute.
      "How long?" Elena asked.
      Amara calculated quickly. "At this rate? The drone convergence will reach critical coverage in less than six hours. Once they establish full mapping capability..."
      "They won't need the council's approval," Kevin finished. "They'll have effective control already."
      The room absorbed this, watching their carefully gathered data paint an increasingly urgent picture. Then Amara noticed something in the Hidden Garden's response patterns, a subtle shift in how the communities were connecting.
      "Look at this," she said, highlighting the changes. "They're not just adapting individually anymore. They're learning from each other. Sharing solutions in real time."
      Ravi leaned in. "The network evolution rate is accelerating. Each adaptation spawns three more."
      "Just like a living system," Nia added, natural pride in her voice.
      "But is it happening fast enough?" Jin asked the question they were all thinking.
      Amara studied the patterns, seeing both threat and hope in the flowing data. "It has to be," she said. "Because if it isn't..."
      She didn't need to finish. They all knew what failure looked like. The Memory Garden held too many records of lost cities, broken communities, controlled growth.
      "Drone formations are tightening," Elena reported. "They're starting their final mapping sweep."
      Amara watched the patterns advance, corporate efficiency meeting community creativity. Tomorrow's council vote felt suddenly distant, almost irrelevant. The real battle was already beginning.
      The true test wasn't just whether they could resist control.
      It was whether they could grow faster than the forces trying to contain them.
      Above them, Luminara's lights flickered as power shifted between official and unofficial networks, between corporate control and community adaptation, between imposed order and organic growth.
      Between what was and what could be.
      The next few hours would decide which future would take root.
