Kaito's message arrived in wind‑code: five‑beat windows for altitude storms; bring rope; bring thread. The message was sparse, efficient in the way that altitude people learned to be—every word earned, nothing wasted when breath was expensive. Wind-code used spacing and cadence where lowland messages used punctuation. Reading it felt like listening.

"They're offering the bowl," Kevin said, looking up from the message with something like reverence. The bowl was sacred space—where the wind elders met, where ceremonies happened, where you didn't go unless you were invited. "And a ledger."

Amara returned timing with the heartbeat handoff and S7 capture: land seed on exhale. Thresholds: drift ±0.3s; 0.5–1.0°C per ten meters; roots if cold. She wrote it three times to make sure the altitude lag wouldn't corrupt it, then sent all three copies by different routes. Redundancy as respect.

"First light," Kevin said, already doing math in his head—transit time, beacon windows, weather volatility at altitude. "Ride the beacons. Keep off Solace air." The route flagged as Ch10‑High‑Garden. Someone drew a tiny knot where the corridor met the bowl, and no one erased it. Amara saw Kevin touch the screen where the knot was, just once, like a promise.

Kaito's second message was a photo of a book with pages made of cloth. The ledger had been stitched together from old work aprons and sail scraps, the thread visible at the spine where someone had bound it with care that exceeded function. On the most recent page, someone had written in a hand that could have been a child's or a scientist's—the pencil pressed hard enough to leave texture in the fabric: five beats holds when the wind forgets itself. Under it, a smudge that might have been rain or tea or the shadow of a thumb from someone who had held the page while the wind tried to take it.

"He's telling us not to be clever," Amara said, zooming in on the smudge. "Just to be on time." She felt the weight of it—all these communities trusting them with their patterns, their breath, their children's sleep. No pressure, just the whole world.

Kevin checked the beacons again like a pilot counting his fingers—first beacon, second beacon, the tertiary backup that only worked in clear weather. "If Solace watchers swing toward the bowl, we'll take the long ridge," he said. "We'll still land on the exhale. We'll just do it quieter." He pulled up the alternate route, checked fuel margins, cursed quietly at the numbers but didn't change his answer.

Ravi's reply rode the light-dream channel back with numbers and a single human sentence at the top: we are listening. He appended a brightline corridor graph and a recording of a concierge saying, "We got fewer fights with the thermostat." Not science. Useful. The kind of proof you could show to someone who didn't trust numbers but knew what a peaceful corridor felt like.

Amara tied a knot in a piece of thread she kept in her pocket when she worked on things that could break—a nervous habit from her first field deployment, when she'd tied and untied the same knot seventeen times while waiting for a relay to stabilize. "For remember," she said, and put it back. The thread was frayed now, gray from pocket lint, but she kept using it. Some rituals earned their keep.

To Kevin: "Pack two more shawls. Bring extra salt." Practical logistics, but they both knew she was really saying trust the weather, trust the wind people, trust that we can do this without perfect conditions.

To herself, quiet enough that Kevin might not hear but probably did: "Don't explain the plan to fear." Another ritual. Another way of saying do the next thing and the thing after that until you've done the whole impossible task.

Kevin nodded without looking at her, his eyes still on the beacon telemetry. "First light," he repeated. "We'll get there." Not a promise—he was too experienced for promises—but a statement of intent that would have to be enough.
