Kaito’s message arrived in wind‑code: five‑beat windows for altitude storms; bring rope; bring thread. “They’re offering the bowl,” Kevin said. “And a ledger.”
      Amara returned timing with the heartbeat handoff and S7 capture: land seed on exhale. Thresholds: drift ±0.3s; 0.5–1.0°C per ten meters; roots if cold.
      “First light,” Kevin said. “Ride the beacons. Keep off Solace air.” The route flagged as Ch10‑High‑Garden. Someone drew a tiny knot where the corridor met the bowl, and no one erased it.

Kaito’s second message was a photo of a book with pages made of cloth. The ledger had been stitched together from old work aprons and sail scraps. On the most recent page, someone had written in a hand that could have been a child’s or a scientist’s: five beats holds when the wind forgets itself. Under it, a smudge that might have been rain or tea.

“He’s telling us not to be clever,” Amara said. “Just to be on time.”

Kevin checked the beacons again like a pilot counting his fingers. “If Solace watchers swing toward the bowl, we’ll take the long ridge,” he said. “We’ll still land on the exhale. We’ll just do it quieter.”

Ravi’s reply rode the light-dream channel back with numbers and a single human sentence at the top: we are listening. He appended a brightline corridor graph and a recording of a concierge saying, “We got fewer fights with the thermostat.” Not science. Useful.

Amara tied a knot in a piece of thread she kept in her pocket when she worked on things that could break. “For remember,” she said, and put it back. To Kevin: “Pack two more shawls. Bring extra salt.” To herself: “Don’t explain the plan to fear.”
