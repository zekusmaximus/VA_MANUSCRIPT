Kaito’s message arrived in wind‑code that Zara read on the first pass and Amara decoded on the second: five‑beat windows for altitude storms; bring rope; bring thread.
      “They’re offering the bowl,” Kevin said, eyes already on flight lines. “And a ledger.”
      Amara sent back timing with the heartbeat mark from New Singapore’s light‑dream handoff and their own S7 capture: land seed on exhale. She added the thresholds and the mercy—±0.3 s drift; 0.5–1.0°C per ten meters; roots if cold.
      “We lift at first light,” Kevin said. “We ride the beacons. We keep off Solace air.”
